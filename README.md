# Next Generation HPC: Spark, Chapel, and TensorFlow 

These are the materials for an introductory workshop on Spark,
Chapel, and TensorFlow - technologies of immediate interest to
researchers performing large-scale numerical computing, who may be
using MPI currently.

The presentation can be viewed at http://ljdursi.github.io/Spark-Chapel-TF-UMich-2016

The intent is that attendees with some experience in scientific
computation and data analysis and some familiarity with python will,
after working through this material:

* Know how to perform some basic canonical scientific computations in each model
* Understand under what regimes MPI, Spark, Chapel, and TensorFlow are best

Included in the materials are the files for a [Vagrant VM](./vm) which contains:

* Spark, and the Jupyter Notebook for Spark
* The Chapel compiler
* The TensorFlow runtime
* Examples in each model
