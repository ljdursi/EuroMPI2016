Abstract
Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study (GWAS) design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits, in particular cardiovascular diseases and lipid biomarkers. The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the key output statistics from single SNP summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (implemented online at http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). We demonstrate the value of the approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including > 100,000 individuals of European ancestry [1]. Our co-localisation results are broadly consistent with the conclusion from the published meta-analysis. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our re-analysis supported 29 out of 38 reported co-localisation results with eQTLs. Two clearly discordant findings ( IFT172, CPNE1), as well as multiple new co-localisation results, highlight the value of a formal systematic statistical test. Our findings provide information about the causal gene in associated intervals and have direct implications for the understanding of complex diseases as well as the design of drugs to target disease pathways.

Introduction
In the last decade, hundreds of genomic loci affecting complex diseases and disease relevant intermediate phenotypes have been found and robustly replicated using genome-wide association studies (GWAS, [2]). At the same time, gene expression measurements derived from microarray [3] or RNA sequencing [4] studies have been used extensively as an outcome trait for the GWAS design. Such studies are usually referred to as expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis. While GWAS datasets have provided a steady flow of positive and replicable results, the interpretation of these findings, and in particular the identification of underlying molecular mechanisms, has proven to be challenging. Integrating molecular level data and other disease relevant intermediate phenotypes with GWAS results is the natural step

forward in order to understand the biological relevance of these results. In this context, a natural question to ask is whether two independent association signals at the same locus, typically generated by two GWAS studies, are consistent with a shared causal variant. If the answer is positive, we refer to this situation as co-localised traits, and the likelihood that both traits are causally linked increases greatly. A typical example involves an eQTL study and a disease association result, which points to the causal gene and the tissue in which the effect is mediated [57]. But the same questions can also be considered between pairs of eQTLs [8, 9], or pairs of diseases [10]. However, identifying the traits that share a common association signal is not a trivial statistical task. Visual comparison of overlaps of association signals with an expression dataset is a step in this direction (using for example Sanger tool Genevar http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/genevar/). The abundance of eQTLs in the human genome and across different tissues makes an accidental overlap between these signals very likely [3]. Therefore visual comparison is not enough to make inferences about causality and formal statistical tests must be used to address this question. Nica et al. [5] proposed a methodology to rank the SNPs with an influence on two traits based on the residual association conditional on the most associated SNP. By comparing the GWAS SNP score with all other SNPs in the associated region, this method accounts for the local LD structure. However this is not a formal test of a null hypothesis for, or against, co-localisation at the locus of interest. A formal test of co-localisation has been developed in a regression framework, either frequentist [11] or Bayesian [12]. In this context, the question of co-localisation amounts to testing whether the estimated regression coefficients against a chosen set of SNPs are proportional between two datasets. Both of these approaches have been shown to be closely linked, at least when the sample size is large [12]. They also share the drawback of having to specify a subset of SNPs to base the test on, and Wallace [13] shows that this step can generate significant biases. The main source of bias is the fact that the causal variant may not always be the most strongly associated one, which can over-estimate the differences between two datasets and reject co-localisation in situations where the causal SNP is in fact shared. Wallace [13] proposes principal component analysis (PC) or Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to overcome the SNP selection problem. An issue with these strategies is the computation time for the BMA approach, and reduced power in the PC approach as the optimal number of components to test is unknown and likely to be locus specific. While these two methods (PC and BMA) address some of the shortcomings of previous work, a limitation is the requirement for individual level genotype data, which are rarely available for large scale eQTL datasets. The success of GWAS meta-analyses has shown that there is considerable benefit in being able to derive association tests on the basis of summary statistics such as p-values, or estimated odds ratio and standard error. With these advantages in mind, He et al [7] developed a statistical test to match the pattern of gene expression with a GWAS dataset. This approach, coded in the software Sherlock, can accommodate p-values as input. However, their hypothesis of interest differs from the question of co-localisation. In particular, SNPs that are not associated with gene expression do not contribute to the test statistic. Such variants can provide strong evidence against co-localisation if they are strongly associated with the GWAS outcome. These limitations motivate the development of novel methodologies to test for the co-localisation between pairs of traits. Here, we derive a novel Bayesian statistical test for co-localisation that addresses many of the shortcomings of existing tools. Our underlying model is closely related to the approach developed by [9], which considers the different but related problem of maximising the power to discover eQTLs in expression datasets of multiple tissues. A key feature of our approach is that it only requires single SNP p-values, combined with closed form analytical results that enable quick comparisons, even at the genome-wide scale. Our procedure provides intuitive posterior probabilities that can be easily interpreted. A key application is the systematic comparison between a new GWAS dataset and a large catalogue of association studies in order to identify novel shared mechanisms. We demonstrate the value of the method by re-analysing a large scale meta-analysis of blood lipids [1] in combination with a gene

Results
Overview of the method
We consider a situation where two traits (denoted by Y1 , Y2 ) have been measured in two distinct datasets of unrelated individuals, drawn from the same ethnic group. We assume that single variant association p-values are available for both datasets at Q variants, typically SNPs but also indels. We make two additional assumptions and discuss later in this paper how these can be relaxed. Firstly, that the causal variant is included in the genotyping panel, either directly typed or well imputed [1517] . Secondly, that at most one association is present for each trait. We are interested in exploring whether the data support a shared causal variant for both traits. While the method is fully applicable to case-control outcome, we consider two quantitative traits in this initial description. SNP causality in a region of Q variants can be summarised for each trait using a vector of length Q of (0, 1) values, where 1 means that the variant is causally associated with the trait of interest and at most one entry is non-zero. A schematic illustration of this framework is provided in Figure 1 in a region that contains 8 SNPs. Each possible pair of vectors (for traits 1 and 2, which we refer to as "configuration") can be assigned to one of five categories:  H0 : No association with either trait	H1 : Association with trait 1, not with trait 2  H2 : Association with trait 2, not with trait 1  H3 : Association with trait 1 and trait 2, two independent SNPs  H4 : Association with trait 1 and trait 2, one shared SNP In this framework, the co-localisation problem can be re-formulated as assessing the support for all configurations (i.e. pairs of binary vectors) in H4 . Our method is Bayesian in the sense that it integrates over all possible configurations. This process requires the definition of prior probabilities which are defined at the SNP level (Methods). A likelihood can be assigned to each configuration, and these likelihoods can be summed over all configurations and combined with the prior to assess the support for each scenario (Hh )5 1 The result of this procedure is five posterior probabilities (PP0, PP1, PP2, PP3 and PP4). A large posterior probability for model 3, PP3, indicates support for two independent causal SNPs associated with each trait. In contrast, if PP4 is large, the data support a shared causal variant. While the method uses approximate Bayes factor computations ( [18], and Methods), no iterative computation scheme (such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain) is required. Therefore, computations are quick and do not require any specific computing infrastructure. Importantly, the use of approximate Bayes factors [18] enable the computation of posterior probabilities from single variant association p-values and minor allele frequencies (MAFs).

Sample size required for co-localisation analysis
Given the well understood requirements for large sample size for GWAS data, we used simulations to investigate the power of our approach in a situation where the causal variant is shared between both traits in the two datasets, the "eQTL dataset" and the "biomarker dataset". Using the original sample size of the liver eQTL dataset described herein [14], and a variance explained of 10% for expression [19, 20], we show the results of simulations for different sample sizes for the biomarker dataset, as well as different

Figure 1. Example of one configuration under different models represented by one binary vector for each trait of (0, 1) values of length n = 8, the number of shared variants in a region. The value of 1 means that the variant is causally involved in disease, 0 that it is not. The first plot shows the case where only one dataset shows an association. The second plot shows that the causal SNP is different for the biomarker dataset compared to the expression dataset. The third plot shows the configuration where the single causal variant is the fourth one. levels of variance explained by the causal variant for the biomarker data (Figure 2). We find that given sample size greater than 1,000 for the biomarker dataset, the causal variant needs to explain close to 1% of the variance of the biomarker and a sample size of 5,000 to provide reliable evidence in favour of a co-localised signal (10th percentile for PP4 > 80%).

The y axis shows the median, 10% and 90% quantile of the distribution of PP4 values (which supports a shared common variant).

Consequence of limited variant density
Owing to the assumption that the causal variant is included in the genotype panel, we hypothesised that the use of non-imputed GWAS data (such as traditional SNP arrays) would have an impact on the computed metrics. To investigate this possibility, we used densely imputed data (in regions covered by the metaboChip array) and only selected the subset of variants that were present on the Illumina 660K genotyping array (all SNPs). We simulated data under the assumption of a shared causal variant, with 4,000 individuals in the biomarker dataset. We then computed the PP4 statistic with and without restricting the SNP set to the Illumina 660K Chip SNPs (Figure 3). We also considered the different scenario whereby the causal SNP is or is not directly genotyped by the Illumina array (see Supplementary Figure 1 and 2 for more exhaustive simulations). Our results show that when the causal variant is directly genotyped by the low density array, the use of imputed data is not essential provided that the sample size is sufficiently large (Figure 3). However, in cases where the causal variant is not typed or imputed,

6

the variance of PP4 is much higher (Figure 3B). In this situation, the resulting PP4 statistic tends to decrease even though considerable variability is observed.

Comparison with existing co-localisation tests
We compared the behaviour of our proposed test with that of proportional co-localisation testing [11, 13] in the specific case of a biomarker dataset with 10,000 samples. Broadly, in the case of either a single common causal variant or two distinct causal variants, our proposed method could confidently infer the simulated scenario correctly (PP4 or PP3 > 0.9) with good confidence, and PP3 > 0.9 slightly more often than the proportional testing p-value < 0.05. However, our proposed method is relatively more affected by using only tagging SNPs compared to proportional testing. We also examined the behaviour when the assumption of a single causal variant was violated. In the case where there were more than two or more causal variants, none common to both traits, H3 consistently had the greatest support. It has been proposed that gene expression may be subject to both global regulatory variation which acts across multiple tissues and secondary tissue specific regulators [21]. Neither approach covers this case explicitly in its construction, but it is instructive to examine their expected behaviour. The proportional approach tends to reject a null of co-localisation, suggesting that a single distinct causal variant can be sufficient to violate the null hypothesis of proportional regression coefficients. In contrast, the Bayesian approach tends to favour the shared variant in the cases covered by our simulations (median PP4 > median PP3), and either H3 or H4 can potentially have strong support (PP4 > 0.9 in close to 50% of simulations, and PP3 > 0.9 in around 25% of cases). Of course, the ultimate goal should be to extend these tests to cover multiple causal variants, but in the meantime, it can be useful to know that a high PP4 in our proposed Bayesian analysis indicates strong support for "at least one causal variant" and that rejection of the null of proportionality of regression coefficients indicates that the two traits do not share

Figure 4. Summary of proportional and Bayesian co-localisation analysis of simulated data in a variety of scenarios. Each plot shows a different scenario, the total number of causal variants in a region is indicated by number of circles in the plot titles with causal variants affecting both traits, the eQTL trait only, or the biomarker trait only, indicated by full circles, top-shaded circles and bottom-shaded circles respectively. For proportional testing, under either a PC or BMA approach, we show the proportion of simulations with p or ppp < 0.05 , while for the Bayesian analysis we plot the proportion of simulations with the posterior probability of the indicated hypothesis > 0.9. Error bars show 95% confidence intervals. In all cases, for the eQTL trait, there are 1,000 samples and genetic variants explain a total of 10% of trait variance; for the biomarker trait, there are 10,000 samples.

Application to a meta-analysis of blood lipids combined with a liver expression dataset
Teslovich et al. [1] reported common variants associated with plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and triglyceride (TG) levels in more than 100,000 individuals of European ancestry. They then reported the correlations between the lead SNPs at the loci they found and the expression levels of transcripts in liver. They defined a region within 500 kilobases of the lead SNP, and the threshold for significance is 10-8 . At this threshold, they found 38 SNP-to-gene eQTLs in liver ( [1] Supplementary Table 8). The liver expression dataset used in

8

this analyses is the same as the one used in Teslovich et al. To assess the role of the prior, we varied the critical parameter p12 , which codes for the prior probability that a variant is associated with both traits. Here we report the results using p12 = 10-5 . The complete list of results is provided in Supplementary Table 1. For the listed loci in table 1 that were reported correlated with both lipid levels and expression in table, our analysis does not support a shared association between primary signal for liver expression and one of the four lipid traits (PP4 < 80%). In addition, we found strong evidence of distinct signals between HLA-DQ/HLA-DR and TC (Supplementary Table 1) but these results must be interpreted with caution owing to the extensive polymorphism in the major histocompatibility complex region. The data support distinct associations (PP3 > 90% and PP4 < 10%) for two loci (IFT172 and TG or TC, CPNE1 and TC), suggesting that expression in liver is not causally associated with the listed traits (table 1 and Supplementary Figure 3). FRK expression and TC (PP3 = 61%), and TBKBP1 and TC PP3 = 78% or LDL PP3 = 47%), do not exclude a shared causal variant, but in these regions with extensive level of LD, it is difficult to obtain firm support for a shared causal variant, which leads to lower PP4 estimates. Two of the loci (SYPL2/LDL or TC, APOC4 and TG) show evidence of co-localisation with expression after conditional analysis. The interpretation of these cases is discussed in the section below. In one case, CEP250, our re-analysis of the expression data did not identify an eQTL for this gene. In such a situation, both PP3 and PP4 are low and PP0, PP1 and PP2 concentrate most of the posterior distribution. We also found several loci not previously reported with a high probability of influencing the lipid traits in liver (PP4 > 80%, Supplementary Tables 2,3,4,5). To explore the possibility that secondary signals may co-localise, we performed the test using conditional analysis results for the eQTL dataset. We found that the secondary signal for SYPL2 is shared with LDL (Figure 5). Table 2 lists all the eQTLs with strong co-localisation support for more than one of the three biomarkers LDL, HDL and TG, suggesting a common pathway between the biomarkers and liver expression.

Dealing with several independent associations for the same trait
We have so far assumed that each trait is associated with at most one causal variant per locus. However, recent studies have shown that it is not unusual to observe two or more independent associations at a locus for a trait of interest [22]. In the presence of multiple associations for either of the two datasets, the

We accommodate for multiple associations by conditioning on the most associated variant, computing conditional p-values and repeating the co-localisation test. Two of the six genes listed in table 1, were found to have a high probability of a shared signal using the conditional association signal for expression. An example of this procedure for the gene SYPL2 and LDL is provided in Figure 5. We find that the top liver eQTL signal is clearly discordant with LDL association (Table 1 and Figure 5). However, conditioning on the top eQTL signal reveals a second independent association for SYPL2 expression in liver. This secondary SYPL2 eQTL co-localises with the LDL association (PP4 > 90%, Figure 5).

Web based resource
We developed a web site designed for integration of GWAS results using only p-values and the sample size of the datasets using RWUI [23]. Results include a list of potentially causal genes with the associated PP4 with their respective plots and ABF, and can be viewed either interactively (http://coloc.cs. ucl.ac.uk/coloc/), or returned by email (http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc_email/). Researchers can request a genome-wide scan of results from a genetic association analysis, and obtain a list of genes with a high probability of mediating the GWAS signals. The tools also allows visualisation of the signals within a genetic region of interest. The database and browser currently include the possibility of investigating co-localisation only with liver expression data, however the resource will soon be extended to include expression in different tissues (including brain, [24, 25]), multiplicity of molecular phenotypes and clinical variables, and different diseases. This method, as well as alternative approaches for co-localisation testing [11,13], are also available in an R package, coloc, from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (http://cran.r-project.org/ web/packages/coloc).

Discussion
We have developed a novel Bayesian statistical procedure to assess whether two association signals are co-localised. The strength of this approach lies in its speed and analytical forms, combined with the fact that it uses single variant p-values. Our method differs from a typical fine-mapping exercise in the sense that we are not interested in knowing which variant, potentially shared between datasets, is likely to be causal but only whether a shared causal variant is plausible. We currently assume that each variant is equally likely to affect gene expression or trait. A straightforward addition to our methodology would consider location specific priors for each variant, which would depend for example on the distance to the gene of interest, or the presence of functional elements in this chromosome region [26, 27]. Our results also show that high genotyping density, and/or accurate use of imputation techniques, are essential to provide an accurate answer to the co-localisation problem. Our comparison with the proportional co-localisation testing approach demonstrates a further advantage of our proposed method. When proportional testing fails to reject its null hypothesis of no co-localisation, it cannot be distinguished whether there truly is a shared causal variant or whether the effects or sample sizes are simply too small to provide sufficient power to reject the null. In contrast, our method clearly provides support for either a shared or distinct causal variants in its partitioning of the hypothesis space. The interpretation of our posterior probabilities requires caution. For example, a low PP4 probability (which supports a shared causal variant) may not imply that the association signals are distinct: if the sample size is not sufficient, PP3 will also be low and it will not be possible to draw meaningful conclusions. Even if PP3 (i.e. the posterior probability supporting different causal variants) is high, one cannot exclude that this might be a consequence of the causal variant not being typed or imputed (Figure 3). Lastly, a high PP4 is a measure of correlation, not causality. To illustrate this point, one can consider the relatively common situation where a single variant appears to affect the expression of several genes in the same chromosome region. All three eQTLs will be co-localised and potentially also co-localised with the biomarker of interest. In this situation one would typically expect that a single gene is causally involved in the biomarker pathway but the co-localisation test with the biomarker will generate high PP4 values for all genes in the interval. We show that we can use conditional p-values to deal with multiple independent associations with the same trait at one locus. The identification of loci with several independent liver eQTLs, with only some of them associated with a biomarker of interest (as in Figure 5), points to intriguing biological mechanisms. Different effects on several isoforms may explain these discrepancies but additional followup will be required to fully understand such loci. In situations where only single SNP summary statistics are available, the approximate conditional meta-analysis framework proposed by Visscher et al [28] can be used to obtain conditional p-values. However, as pointed out by Wallace [13], this top SNP selection for the conditional analysis can create biases. In addition, several independent associations with similar level of significance can affect the behaviour of the co-localisation test. Alternatively, if individual genotype data are available, one can estimate Bayes factors for pairs of variants rather than single variants. This modification would allow up to two associations per trait while avoiding the issue of SNP selection for the conditional analysis. It would also address the issue of the potential confusion created by several independent associations at the same level of significance. At the expense of computational speed, this solution can be extended to all set of n variants hence enabling up to n independent associations per locus and per outcome trait. Importantly, GWAS signals can be explained by eQTLs only when the causal variant affects the phenotype by altering the amount of protein production, but not when the phenotype is affected by changing the type of protein produced, although the former seems to be the most common [29]. Furthermore, since many diseases manifest their phenotype in certain tissues exclusively [3, 21, 30, 31], co-localisation results will be dependent on the expression dataset used. In addition to identifying the causal genes, the iden-

11

tification of tissue specificity for the molecular effects underlying GWAS signals is a key outcome of our method. We anticipate that building a reference set of eQTL studies in multiple tissues will provide a useful check for every new GWAS dataset, pointing directly to potential candidate genes/tissue types where these effects are mediated. While this report focuses on finding shared signals between a biomarker dataset and a liver expression dataset, we plan to utilise summary results of multiple GWAS and eQTL studies, for a variety of cell types and traits. Disease/disease, eQTL/disease or disease/biomarkers comparisons are all of biological interest. We expect that the fact that the test can be based on single SNP p-values will be key to overcome data sharing concerns, hence enabling a large scale implementation of this tool. The increasing availability of RNA-Seq eQTL studies will further increase the opportunity to detect isoform specific eQTLs and their relevance to disease studies. Owing to the increasing availability of GWAS datasets, the systematic application of this approach will potentially provide clues into the molecular mechanisms underlying GWAS signals and the aetiology of the disorders.

Materials and Methods
Expression dataset
We used in our analysis gene expression and genotype data from 966 human liver samples. The samples were collected post-mortem or during surgical resection from unrelated European-American subjects from two different non-overlapping studies, which have been described in [14]. The cohorts were both genotyped using Illumina 650Y BeadChip array, and 39,000 expression probes were profiled using Agilent human gene expression arrays. All of the expression data has been normalised as one unit even though they were part of different studies, since high concordance between data generated using the same array platforms has been previously reported. Probe sequences were searched against the human reference genome GRCh37 from 1000genomes using BLASTN. Multiple probes mapping to one gene were kept in order to examine possible splicing. The probes were kept and annotated to a specific gene if they were entirely included in genes defined by Ensembl ID or by HGNC symbol using the package biomaRt in R [32].

Imputation of genetic data
Quality control filters were applied both before and after imputation. Before imputation, individuals with more than 10% missing genotypes were removed, and SNPs showing a missing rate greater than 10%, a deviation for HWE at a p-value less than 0.001 were dropped. After imputation, the SNPs were filtered using the imputation quality score Rsq > 0.3 and MAF > 0.001. Monomorphic SNPs were excluded from analyses. To speed up the imputation process, the genome was broken into small chunks that were phased and imputed separately and then re-assembled. This was achieved using the ChunkChromosome tool (http: //genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/ChunkChromosome), and specifying chunks of 1000 SNPs, with an overlap window of 200 SNPs on each side, which improves accuracy near the edges during the phasing step. Each chunk was phased using the program MACH1 (Versions 1.0.18, downloaded from: http: //www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/download/) with the number of states set to 300 and the number of rounds of MCMC set to 20 for all chunks. Phased haplotypes were used as a basis for imputation of untyped SNPs using the program Minimac (version 2011.10.27, downloaded from: http: //www.sph.umich.edu/csg/cfuchsb/minimac-beta-2012.8.15.tgz)) with 1000 Genomes EUR reference haplotypes (phase1 version 3, March 2012) to impute SNPs not genotyped on the Illumina array. Since Minimach uses the squared correlation (Rsq) between imputed and true genotypes as an imputation quality measure, only SNPs with a Rsq greater than 0.3 were used, and SNPs with a MAF  0.05 were

12

dropped post-imputation. The data was then collated in probability format that can be used by the R Package snpStats [32].

Biomarker dataset
The biomarker p-values from the meta-analyses (with control correction) were obtained from a publicly available repository (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/public/lipids2010/). After mapping and annotating the probes, we were left with 40,548 mapped probes and expression measurements on 25,621 genes. eQTL p-values were obtained by fitting a linear trend test regression between the expression of each gene and all variants 200 kilobases upstream and downstream from each probe. After filtering the variants with MAF < 0.001, multi-allelic SNPs (as reported in 1000 Genomes or in the Ensembl database) and variants not sufficiently well imputed (Rsq < 0.3, as defined by minimac http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/minimac) between both datasets, we applied our co-localisation procedure.

Posterior Computation
We call a "configuration" one possible combination of pairs of vectors. We can group the configurations into five sets, S0 , S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 , containing assignments of all SNPs Q to the functional role corresponding to the five hypotheses H0 , H1 , H2 , H3 , H4 . We can compute the posterior probabilities for each of these 5 hypotheses in the following way. Following a Bayesian approach, the likelihood of the data under each model are computed by combining information on the observed data Y with the prior probability of a configuration, summed over a set of configurations. L(Hh ) =
S Sh

L(D|S )P (S )

(1)

where L(Hh ) is the likelihood of the observed data D under any h=(1,2,3,4) hypotheses excluding the null, and P(S) is the prior probability of a configuration, summed over a set of configurations. This way each likelihood is weighted by the probability that it will occur. To compute the posterior probability, we take the ratio of likelihoods under the different models. For example for the posterior probability under model 4 we have: PP4 = L(H4 ) L(H0 ) + L(H1 ) + L(H2 ) + L(H3 ) + L(H4 ) (2)

If we also divide each probability by the baseline L(H0 ) we get: PP4 = 1+
L(H4 ) L(H0 ) L(H2 ) L(H3 ) L(H0 ) + L(H0 )

L(H1 ) L(H0 )

+

+

L(H4 ) L(H0 )

(3)

The ratios in the numerator and denominator of equation 3 are: L(Hh ) = L(H0 ) L(D|S ) P (S )  L(D|S0 ) P (S0 ) (4)

S Sh

The first ratio in this equation is a Bayes Factor (BF) for each configuration, and the second ratio is the prior odds of a configuration compared with the baseline configuration S0 . The BF can be computed from the p-value using Wakefield's method. By summing over all configurations in Sh we are effectively comparing the support in the data for one alternative model versus the null model.

Bayes factor computation
A Bayes Factor for each SNP j and each trait 1 and 2 was computed using the Asymptotic Bayes Factor (ABF, [18]). Wakefield's method yields a Bayes factor from the p-value that measures relative support for a model in which the SNP is associated with the trait compared to the null model of no association. The equation used is the following: ABF =  Z2 1  exp - r 2 1-r

 ^ V is the usual Z statistic and the shrinkage factor r is the ratio of the variance of the where Z = / prior and total variance (r = W/(V + W )). Assuming a normal distribution, the p-value of each SNP can be converted to standard one-tailed Z-score by using inverse normal cumulative distribution function. So for a SNP, all that it is needed are the p-values from a standard regression output, and W , the standard deviation of the normal prior N(0,W) on  . More details can be found in the Supplementary materials.

Choice of priors
We assigned a prior of 1  10-4 for p1 and p2 , the probability that a SNP is associated with either of the two traits. Since all SNPs are assumed to have the same prior probability of association, this prior can be interpreted as an estimate for the proportion of SNPs that we expect to be associated with the trait in question. Although our knowledge about this is still lacking, this estimate has been suggested in the literature in the context of GWAS [18, 33, 34]. We also assigned a prior probability of 1	10-5 for p12 , the probability that one SNP is associated with both traits. This probability can be better understood as the conditional probability of a SNP being associated with trait 2, given that it is associated with trait 1. So assigning a probability of 1	10-5 means that 1 in 10 SNPs that are associated with trait 1 is also associated with the other. As a sensitivity analysis, we ran the comparison with Teslovich et al. using two other prior probabilities for p12 , p12 = 2  10-6 which means 1 in 50 SNPs that are associated with one trait is also associated with the other; and p12 = 10-6 which means 1 in 100 SNPs. Nicolae et al. [29] demonstrated that SNPs associated with complex traits identified using the catalogue of GWAS results http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/ are more likely to be eQTLs in lymphoblastoid cell lines compared to other SNPs chosen from a GWAS platform, and some studies have proposed to use higher weighting for SNPs associated with traits when performing Bayesian association analyses [35, 36]. Also, eQTLs have been shown to be enriched for disease-associated SNPs when a disease-relevant tissue is used [8, 37]. To compute the ABF, we also needed to specify the standard deviation for the prior, and we set this to 0.20 for binary traits and 0.15 for quantitative traits (more details in Supplementary).
