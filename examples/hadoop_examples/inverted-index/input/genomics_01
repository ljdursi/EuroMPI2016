ABSTRACT The identification and validation of gene-gene interactions is a major challenge in human studies. Here, we explore an approach for studying epistasis in humans using a Drosophila melanogaster model of neonatal diabetes mellitus. Expression of mutant preproinsulin, hINSC96Y, in the eye imaginal disc mimics the human disease activating conserved cell stress response pathways leading to cell death and reduction in eye area. Dominant-acting variants in wild-derived inbred lines from the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel produce a continuous, highly heritable, distribution of eye degeneration phenotypes. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 154 sequenced lines identified 29 candidate SNPs in 16 loci with P < 10-5 including one SNP in an intron of the gene sulfateless (sfl) which exceeded a conservative genome-wide significance threshold of P = 0.05 level (-log10 P > 7.62). RNAi knock-downs of sfl enhanced the eye degeneration phenotype in a mutant-hINS-dependent manner. sfl encodes a protein required for sulfation of the glycosaminoglycan, heparan sulfate. Two additional genes in the heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthetic pathway (tout velu, ttv and brother of tout velu, botv) also modified the eye phenotype, suggesting a link between HS-modified proteins and cellular responses to misfolded proteins. Finally, intronic variants marking the QTL were associated with decreased sfl expression, a result consistent with that predicted by RNAi studies. The ability to create a model of human genetic disease in the fly, map a QTL by GWAS to a specific gene (and noncoding variant), validate its contribution to disease with available genetic resources, and experimentally link the variant to a molecular mechanism, demonstrate the many advantages Drosophila holds in determining the genetic underpinnings of human disease.

The first is a Bonferroni corrected threshold at P = 0.05 level (-log10 P > 7.62). This is conservative because it assumes all tests are independent while the number of independent SNPs must be much smaller than the total number tested. The second is an arbitrary threshold of P < 10-5 (or 10-6) as suggested by Mackay et al. (Mackay et al., 2012). We estimated the false discovery rate (FDR) associated with a P < 10-5 threshold by using X chromosome SNPs as negative controls and assuming an equal FDR between X chromosome and autosomes. We also compared the number of QTLs passing this threshold with an empirical null distribution by randomizing the phenotype relative to the genotype 2,000 times and carrying out GWAS on each of the permuted datasets.

-induced eye phenotype

We crossed the transgenic fly line (w; P{GMR-Gal4}, P{UAS-hINSC96Y }/CyO) as the maternal parent to 178 inbred lines from DGRP representing a spectrum of natural variation (excluding recessive lethal variants eliminated in the formation of the DGRP). Among several eye phenotypes observed -- rough eye, reduced total area, distortion of the oval shape and black lesion spots -- we chose total eye area as the phenotype to carry out a GWAS. We quantified eye area in ten male progeny from each hINSC96Y x DGRP cross. We observed a continuously varying distribution of this phenotype, ranging from 13% to 86% of wild type fly eye area (Figure 1). ANOVA indicated that nearly 60% of the variance is between genotypes, indicating a large genetic component. Males were chosen for measurement and analysis because they showed a more severe phenotype than females (Park et al., 2013). However, we also measured F1 females for a subset of 38 lines and found a strong correlation between the two sexes from the same cross (r=0.8, Figure S2).

We restricted the analysis to bi-allelic sites for which the minor allele was present in at least four lines (Mackay et al., 2012). Because of the direction of the cross, all F1 males inherited their X-chromosome from the GMR>>hINSC96Y tester line and we expected to observe no association between the phenotype and X-linked SNPs. Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots for autosomal and Xchromosomal SNPs revealed that only the former and not the latter showed an excess of small p-values (Figure 2A,B). We observed association of a SNP (list SNP) on chromosome 3L with eye area (Figure 2C), with a p-value that approached genomewide significance (raw P = 2.4 x10-8, Bonferroni corrected P = 0.0502). The Bonferroni correction is conservative because whereas it assumes complete independence of SNPs, LD is common between SNPs separated by short distances. To identify additional association beyond the peak on chromosome 3L, we used the threshold P < 10-5 suggested by (Mackay et al., 2012) for nominating candidate SNPs. Thirty SNPs, 29 of which were on autosomes and one on the X chromosome, were identified using this criteria (Table S3). The 29 autosomal SNPs were distributed in 16 unlinked loci. Two methods were used to assess the false discovery rate (FDR) at this threshold. First, assuming that the FDR for autosomal and X-linked SNPs are the same, we expected 6.5 autosomal SNPs while observing 29, suggesting a FDR of 22%. Second, we randomized the phenotype relative to the genotype 2,000 times and carried out GWAS on each of the permuted datasets. The resulting number of SNPs passing the threshold in each of the 2,000 trials had a mean of 21 and a median of 19, with the observed number 29 at the 85th percentile. Both methods suggest a modest enrichment of true positives under the 10-5 threshold.

Figure 3 RNAi knockdown confirms sfl and excludes CG32396 as the causal gene. The effect of knocking down either CG32396 or sfl was tested in the absence ({UASRNAi} x {GMR-Gal4}) or presence ({UAS-RNAi} x {GMR-Gal4, UAS-hINSC96Y}) of hINSC96Y. Compared to the control crosses (first and third columns in both sexes), significant difference in mean eye area was observed only with RNAi against sfl and only in the presence of hINSC96Y (n=15, asterisks above a box plot indicate significant differences at 0.05 level determined by a student's t-test, with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing). In box plots, the median (black dot), interquartile (box) and 1.5 times the interquartile range (whiskers) are indicated; data points outside the range are represented by circles.

(A) Alignment of 19 DGRP sequences ordered by their eye degeneration phenotype (mean, most severe on the bottom). The hINSC96Y transgenic line (asterisk) was also sequenced. Red ticks and white spaces indicate SNPs and deletions relative to the reference sequence. No insertions relative to the reference were found. The purple track shows the -log10 of GWAS p-values. The bottom track shows the linkage blocks as determined by Haploview (4.02) using the solid spine method with default settings (D' > 0.8). (B) Detailed haplotype block structures. Each numbered column represents a polymorphic site, with the alleles colored as blue or red; each row represents a haplotype with frequency > 0.01. An arrowhead marks the 18/4bp indel polymorphism (see text; 18bp: blue; 4bp: red). Finally, the number between any two blocks represents the multi-allelic D', which quantifies the associations between adjacent blocks.

Two crosses, however, showed slightly greater expression from the 4 bp allele (18 bp/4 bp ratios of 0.94 and 0.96). The remaining six crosses showed no significant differences in expression of the two alleles. The trend towards more expression of the transcript linked to the 18bp allele supports the hypothesis that the 18/4 bp intronic polymorphism (and/or other SFPs in the 400bp LD block) modulates sfl expression. However, heterogeneity in allele-specific expression between crosses indicates the presence of additional cis-acting expression variants.

HSPG are also involved in endocytocis (Ren et al., 2009; Stanford et al., 2009) and vesicular trafficking (Nybakken & Perrimon, 2002; Sarrazin et al., 2011), roles that link them to cellular response to misfolded proteins (Higashio & Kohno, 2002; Kim et al., 2009; Kimmig et al., 2012). It is feasible that HSPGs influence membrane trafficking indirectly, perhaps by regulating signaling events that impinge on trafficking processes. The generation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] by type I phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinases is affected by a number of growth factors and cytokines, many of which are influenced by HSPGs as accessory molecules. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 affects a number of trafficking events, including endocytosis and autophagy (Downes et al., 2005). In a yeast study of the mutant protein folding assistant, protein disulfide isomerase (Pdi1a'), the authors found that more than half of the 130 genes identified as syntheticlethal were related to vesicle trafficking, while only 10 belonged to the canonical unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway (Kim et al., 2009). In another study, Kimmig et al found an enrichment of vesicle-trafficking related genes among those that changed expression significantly after induction of ER-stress (Kimmig et al., 2009). Both studies indicate that a global regulation of vesicle trafficking is important to a cell's response to unfolded or misfolded protein. Activation of UPR has also been shown to affect ER-toGolgi transport via stimulation of COPII vesicle formation from the ER (Higashio & Kohno, 2002). We therefore propose that either natural variation or genetic perturbation of HS biosynthesis influences the global regulation of vesicle trafficking, which in turn affects cells' ability to process an excess of unfolded or misfolded protein. Prolonged ER-stress may then lead to apoptosis.

We applied a mixed-linear model to the mean phenotype for the 154 crosses to estimate the total contribution of common variants to the phenotypic variance (Yang et al., 2010). This method does not identify individual SNP, and thus does not suffer from the multiple-testing burden as in GWAS. Applying this method (Yang et al., 2011), 52% (standard error = 28%) of the variance between crosses (i.e. genotypes) can be attributed to common, autosomal variants with minor allele frequencies greater than 5%. Although this estimate has a large standard error, resulting from the limited number of lines, it nevertheless indicates contributions by many additive factors beyond sfl, most of which likely have small effect sizes or low population frequencies, making them not detectable in our study. An additional layer of genetic complexity was revealed when we tested the effects of the intronic SFPs on sfl expression. Among the 15 crosses where we randomly paired an 18bp allele line with a 4bp allele line from DGRP, seven showed greater expression from the 18bp-linked allele than the 4bp-linked allele; six showed no significant differences while two showed small, yet significant differences in the opposite direction. While the general trend is as expected (Figure 6), the phenotypic heterogeneity suggested that additional variation is influencing sfl expression. The variants most likely lie within the sfl locus because the experiment specifically measures allele-specific expression in heterozygotes, which means any trans-variant will have to act in an allelespecific manner. A conditional analysis using the 18bp/4bp polymorphism as a covariate failed, however, to identify secondary SFPs in the sfl locus, most likely due to lack of power.

be genetic, such as driver mutations in cancer, but could also be environmental, such as diet and life-style changes in the case of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Consistent with this view, it has been proposed that recent genome evolution and rapid environmental as well as cultural changes in human history have decanalizing effects on physiology, which release cryptic genetic variation and underlie the rising incidence of common human disorders (Gibson, 2009). A genetic screen for naturally occurring modifiers in a sensitized background, such as the one we employed here, should apply equally well in the study of Mendelian or complex disease. Were this not the case, two different classes of genetic modifiers would have to be posited. An intriguing question, which we found little empirical evidence for or against, could be addressed in the fly by constructing a series of sensitized backgrounds utilizing different disease-causing mutant hINS alleles of varying effect on disease (e.g., neonatal diabetes vs. maturity-onset diabetes of the young Sty et al., 2007), and comparing the composition of naturally occurring modifiers. Advantages of a fly model of complex disease A primary mutation can manifest itself in different ways and with tissue-specific effects (Mefford et al., 2008), possibly a consequence of its interdependence with the individual's genetic background. The binary Gal4-UAS system enables the creation of a series of models using the same disease mechanism, but directed to different tissues with high tissue-specificity. The ability to construct and study multiple related models in parallel can provide insight into the basis of disease heterogeneity. In the accompanying paper we show, for example, that the developing eye and notum have different sets of genetic background modifiers of mutant hINS-dependent disease (Park et al., 2013). Sex-specific difference in disease risk and severity are also readily modeled in the fly. In both the fly and mouse model of hINSC96Y-induced disease, males consistently show more severe disease phenotypes (Wang et al., 1999, Park et al., 2013). Drosophila models of human disease provide a useful alternative to the study of a complex disease in patient populations. First, many models of human disease have been established in the fly, most notably neurodegeneration and cancer (Bilen & Bonini, 2005; Gonzalez, 2013). We predict that natural variation will influence the severity of disease phenotypes in all of them. Second, many models of disease can be created by over-expression of a mutant allele, which makes them suitable for F1 screens between a tester stock and inbred population collections, such as we employed here. Our study shows that an impressive amount of genetic variation for disease severity is dominant or semi-dominant; this outcrossing design also avoids unwanted effects of inbreeding on traits and better mimics the natural heterozygosity of low frequency variants. Third, this experimental design facilitates repeated measurement of a disease phenotype, thereby increasing the power to detect a causal association (Mackay et al., 2009). Fourth, LD is low in D. melanogaster and SNP is 20-40X more abundant than in human. Finally, both forward and reverse genetics can be applied to investigate the biology and pathway genetics of candidate variants. For all these reasons we believe fly models will prove useful in understanding the genetic architecture of complex human disease.

Figure S6 qRT-PCR quantification of mRNA levels for CG32396 and sfl in eye imaginal disc samples. Two inbred lines from DGRP were randomly chosen and eye imaginal disc samples were prepared from either 6 male or 6 female larvae, resulting in 4 biological samples. qRT-PCR were performed for each sample and three genes (RP49 -- red curve, sfl -- yellow, and CG32396 -- green). Shown is the amplification plot: x-axis -- cycle number; y-axis -- base-line corrected relative fluorescence intensity proportional to the amount of amplicons. Both RP49 and sfl were detected starting in the 18-20th cycle, while amplification didn't happen for CG32396 until after 32 cycle. In addition, multiple melting points were detected for CG32396 assays, but not in the other two genes.

In each category, the first three bars represent three independent female larvae sample (whole larva), each assayed with three technical replicates. The height of the bar represent the mean and the full range of RQ values were indicated by the error bars. The next three bars correspond to three independent male larvae assayed for the same gene. kl-3 and Pp1-Y2 are both located on the Y-chromosome and are known to have a testis-specific expression level. The RQ values were measured using RP49 gene as the internal control, and the first female larva sample (F-1) as the reference, whose RQ is set to one.

This reduction is more severe in the sfl knockdown genotype than in the hINAC96Yexpressing genotype. Co-expression of sfl RNAi and hINS C96Y by dpp-Gal4

results in the obliteration of the L3 vein and further relative reduction of the L2-L4 area. (A): Wild type wing showing the measured regions of wing used to quantify the effects of both sfl RNAi and hINSC96Y expression in dpp-Gal4 domain (L3-L4 intervein sector). Quantification of the (B) female or (E) male wing phenotypes generated by transgenes dpp-Gal4; dpp-Gal4 >UAS-hINSC96Y; (C, G) dpp-Gal4 >> UAS-sfl RNAi; and (D, H) dpp-Gal4 >>UAS-sfl RNAi; UAS-hINSC96Y. The values represent the ratio of the third posterior cell (in pink color) divided by the L2-L4 intervein sector (in green color) wing area. ***, P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test. Females: dpp-Gal4 (n= 15; Mean= 0.62), dpp-Gal4 >UAS-hINSC96Y (n= 15; Mean=0.65), dpp-Gal4 >> UAS-sfl RNAi (n= 23; Mean=1.3) and dpp-Gal4 >>UAS-sfl RNAi; UAS-hINSC96Y (n= 22; Mean=1.76). Males: dpp-Gal4 (n= 15; Mean=0.59), dpp-Gal4 >UAS-hINSC96Y (n= 15; Mean=0.64), dpp-Gal4 >> UAS-sfl RNAi (n=23; Mean=1.2 ) and dpp-Gal4 >>UAS-sfl RNAi; UAS-hINSC96Y (n= 29; Mean=1.68).

Figure S9 Depletion of sfl by RNAi in the developing notum expressing hINSC96Y driven by ap-Gal4. For both females and males, ap > hINSC96Y or ap > sfl RNAi expression alone reduces notum area and causes loss of dorsal macrochaetae. Co-expression of sfl RNAi and hINSC96Y by ap-Gal4 results in greater destruction of the notum and macrochaetae in both sexes. However, in the male the notum and additional dorsal structures are obliterated and this phenotype is lethal. ap-Gal4 > hINSC96Y (A) female and (D) male; ap-Gal4 > sfl RNAi (B) female and (E) male; ap-Gal4>> hINSC96Y, sfl RNAi (C) female (F) male

Biological replicate

Figure S10 log2 transformed ratios between transcript levels associated with 18bp/4bp alleles. The allele-specific expression ratios were measured in F1 hybrid individuals by pyro-sequencing, with three (or four) biological replicates and four (or three) pyro-technical replicates, to obtain a total of 12 measurements. In each of the 15 crosses, the technical replicates were plotted in a single column, with different columns representing the biological replicates. In the titles of each panel, the last three digits in the stock number were shown for lines used in the cross.

The intronic 18/4bp polymorphism in sfl is included in the linear model as a covariate. The two dotted lines in (A) correspond to a single test 0.05 level (red) and the multiple testing corrected 0.05 level using Bonferroni's method (blue). The red line in (B) represents the Bonferroni corrected 0.05 level.
