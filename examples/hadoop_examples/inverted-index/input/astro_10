Abstract: The differences between cold (CDM) and warm (WDM) dark matter in the formation of a group of galaxies is examined by running two identical simulations where in the WDM case the initial power spectrum has been altered to mimic a 1keV dark matter particle. The CDM initial conditions were constrained to reproduce at z = 0 the correct local environment within which a "Local Group" (LG) of galaxies may form. Two significant differences between the two simulations are found. While in the CDM case a group of galaxies that resembles the real LG forms, the WDM run fails to reproduce a viable LG, instead forming a diffuse group which is still expanding at z = 0. This is surprising since, due to the suppression of small scale power in its power spectrum, WDM is naively expected to only affect the collapse of small haloes and not necessarily the dynamics on a scale of a group of galaxies. Furthermore the concentration of baryons in halo center's is greater in CDM than in WDM and the properties of the disks differ.

Introduction

The current paradigm of galaxy formation, known as Cold Dark Matter (CDM), holds that structures in the universe grow in a bottom-up hierarchical fashion (e.g. White and Rees 1978). The universe's initial conditions are conceived as a smooth roughly homogenous expanse of gas and dark matter (DM). In CDM, small perturbations imprinted on the primordial density field grow via gravitational instabilities, and then merge with each other to create the complex structures (such as clusters, groups of galaxies, galactic haloes, filaments, sheets and voids) we observed today. Warm DM (WDM), an alternative to CDM, suggests that initial perturbations below a certain mass cannot collapse and as such the smallest structures to form out of gravitational instability are fairly large (e.g.  1010 h-1 M Bode et al. 2001; Zavala et al. 2009). This

is because the temperature of the DM particle at decoupling (specifically, whether it was relativistic or not) can cause the DM particle to escape from and erase the underlying density fluctuation. This process, known as "free streaming", inhibits the formation of small structures by gravitational collapse. The initial power spectrum of fluctuations, which can be measured directly from the CMB, describes the degree of "contrast" in the density field and can be compared with the large scale clustering of galaxies observed in sky surveys (such as the SDSS or 2DF). These measurements probe the power spectrum on scales much greater than those scales where the nature of the dark matter can be probed. A number of suggestions as to the mass of DM particles have recently been proposed (e.g. Boyarsky et al. 2009b,a) which corresponds to the lack of DM haloes less than  106 M	roughly the mass of the small-

AHF2 . We refer the reader to the code description papers (Gill et al. 2004; Knollmann and Knebe 2009) for details. AHF locates local over-densities in an adaptively smoothed density field as prospective halo centers. The potential minimum of each density peak is then calculated; bound particles are then associated to possible haloes. In the WDM simulation, discreteness effects which can cause haloes below a specific limit mass ( Mlim ) to arise from the unphysical numerical fragmentation of filaments, is an issue. In order to protect our analysis against these artificially formed haloes we use the value of Mlim provided by Wang and White (2007) as the minimum trusted mass for a halo in the WDM simulation. Their expression, originally based upon Hot Dark Matter models, reads Mlim = 10.1  d /k 2 peak , where   is the mean density, d is the mean interparticle separation, and k peak is the wavenumber at which 2 (k) = k3 P(k) reaches its maximum. In our WDM run, where the power spectrum has been modified to correspond to a 1keV particle, the values of this limiting mass is Mlim  2.6 x107 M /h, which corresponds roughly to a 100 particle limit. In practice in both the CDM or WDM simulation, only objects whose mass is greater than 500 particles are used. We note that since the simulations have identical baryonic physics, particle mass and spatial resolutions any of the differences reported here are due entirely to the nature of the DM model.

3 Cosmography
We begin with a cosmographic description of the two simulated groups. Our simulations produce three dominant objects which we name galaxy A, B and C in decreasing mass. In the CDM case these closely resemble the Milky Way (MW), Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33). An image of the two groups can be seen in Fig. 1. Two salient aspects of WDM are immediately apparent from this figure: (1) there are far fewer small substructures and (2) the two groups differ substantially, cosmographically speaking. In Figure 3(a,c) we show the co-moving and physical distance between the three pairs of group members as a function of look back time, normalized to the z = 0 value. In the CDM simulation, the physical separation of each pair of galaxies reaches a maximum "turn-around" (at a look back time of around 6 Gyrs for galaxy B-A and galaxy B - C pair and around a few Gyrs later for galaxy A - C). In the WDM simulation this is not the case: the physical distance between each pair of haloes at every redshift is smaller than the corresponding distance at redshift zero, indicating that the Hubble expansion is the dominant force at every epoch and that all three pairs of galaxies have

yet to begin approaching each other. Accordingly, the group is more compact in CDM than in WDM. Using these specific initial conditions, over densities that turn around and are on a collision course at a given epoch in cosmic time in CDM, have yet to approach each other in WDM: where CDM produces an attracting, collapsing group of galaxies, WDM produces a still expanding version. This is our first result: Using initial conditions, whose only difference is a suppression of small scale power, the defining dynamics of the a group of galaxies are completely different in CDM and WDM, with the former predicting an attracting group that resembles the LG, while the later predicting a still expanding one. The co-moving distances (shown as the thick lines in Fig. 3a,c) show monotonic attractions. In the WDM case the simulated haloes are closer to each other (relative to their z = 0 distances) at early times than the CDM halos. In the CDM case, by z = 0 the haloes have been brought closer. Note that the small kinks in the A -C system (CDM) and B - C system (WDM case) appear due to false identification of the main progenitor in the merger tree construction at a given snapshot. We now examine the evolution of the three individual group members by examining the mass accretion history shown in Fig. 3(b,d). In both the CDM and WDM run, the two most massive galactic haloes (A and B) show jumps in the mass accretion history characteristic of merger activity occurring more or less continuously. Often, these haloes appear to lose mass after a violent major merger. This is because of the unique merger history of these objects - violent mergers may bring material into the virial radius that is bound at one redshift, but which may become unbound and flung out at a later time. The smallest halo (C) on the other hand shows little evidence of major mergers in its past. Although the mass growth histories look similar, in fact they differ slightly. The time at which half of the z = 0 mass has been assembled is shown in each plot as a filled circle. In the WDM simulation, each halo assembles 50% of its mass later with respect to the CDM model. Specifically, in the WDM run halo A, B and C accrete half-mass at a look-back time of	4,  6, and  9.5Gyrs, respectively. In the CDM case this occurs at  7,  7 and  10Gyrs: that is  3,  1,  0.5 Gyrs earlier. Since B and C are smaller mass haloes, their half mass times are considerably earlier and the delay is considerably smaller than for halo A. A characteristic feature of the WDM model emerges here: the finite primordial phase-space density due to the large thermal velocities of the particles causes most of the mass to undergo gravitational collapse at later redshift (z < 5), resulting in the suppression of halo formation at higher redshift (Bode et al. 2001). Halo collapse is thus delayed with respect to the CDM model. Although not a new result, this finding directly informs

This is true for all radii in halo A, and for radii greater than 0.03rvir for halo B and C (although in halo B, there is more gas in CDM for r < 0.2rvir ). The higher gas fractions in WDM may inhibit infalling substructures from depositing their material in the center of the halo thereby suppressing the baryon fraction in the inner parts of WDM halos, as seen in Fig. 4(d)-(f). Both gas and stars form well defined discs, a consequence of the star formation rules we have used. This can be quantified by performing a dynamical bulge-disc decomposition. There are a number of ways this is done in the literature (e.g Abadi et al. 2003; Scannapieco et al. 2010; Sales et al. 2012). In this work we dynamically decompose star and gas particles within the inner 10 kpc into disc-like and bulge-like components using two methods, one for each component (as in Knebe et al. 2013). For both methods a "disc-axis", taken to be the total angular momentum of all baryonic particles within 10kpc, must be assumed. For gas particles we follow Scannapieco et al. (2010); the component of each particle's angular momentum in this direction ( Jz ) is computed and compared with the angular momentum a particle would have at that radius if it were on a circular orbit. The ratio Jz / Jcirc is computed where: Jcirc = = r  vcirc r GM (r) r (1) (2)

Internal Halo Properties

How do the different cosmographies and histories change the internal structure of each of our three LG objects? In Fig. 4(a)-(c) we show the density profile of the three LG members in both WDM (dashed) and CDM (solid) simulations. All density profiles are standard NFW fits, and in all three cases the WDM is nearly indistinguishable from the CDM. That said, owing to the lower mass of the WDM haloes, their density profiles are systematically shifted to slightly lower densities. In Fig 4(d)-(f) we show the cumulative baryon fraction as a function of radius. Again, WDM and CDM show broad similarities in shape and value of the baryon fraction. In the inner parts, WDM shows a systematically lower baryon fraction. At around	0.03rvir , the total fraction of internal mass in baryons is roughly the same in both cosmologies. Towards the outer parts of the halo, the baryon fraction of both cosmologies drops, reaching the cosmic mean of  0.1 at the virial radius. That CDM haloes have more concentrated baryons is likely due to a number of combining factors: their earlier formation time, their greater mass and thus their deeper potential. This is our second main result: WDM haloes have lower baryon fractions in their inner parts where baryons dominate, than CDM haloes. The baryonic properties of the three Local Group members are summarized in Table 2. The fraction of mass in a gaseous component is presented in Fig. ??(g)-(i). Although each halo shows different specific behavior, some interesting similarities exist. Firstly, the fraction of mass in gas is almost al-

Here M (r) is the total mass (including DM) within a radius r. Note that in this formulation, particles with Jz / Jcirc  1 are on circular orbits and thus compose a disc. Note that Jz > Jcirc and thus the ratio ranges from (0,).

Table 2: Properties of the three main galaxies in the CDM and WDM simulation. For each halo we show the number (Nvir ) and mass ( Mvir ) of stars, gas and all particles within the virial radius. We present the baryon fraction within the virial radius ( fb,vir ).

For star particles we follow Abadi et al. (2003) and compare the component of the angular momentum in the z-direction with the angular momentum of a circular orbit of the same energy, Jc (E ). First, the total (kinetic plus potential) energy of each particle is computed. Since circular orbits maximize angular momentum, the maximum value of Jz for all particles with a given energy is taken as Jc (E ). In this case the ratio Jz / Jc (E ) is confined to the interval [-1,1], where negative values imply counter-rotation with respect to total angular momentum of all baryonic particles within 10kpc. Two different methods for gas and star particles are used because of the nature of the the methods themselves. The Abadi et al. method is more appropriate for N -body particles where the energy is simply kinetic plus potential. Gas particles have an extra component (internal energy) which informs their dynamics. In this case its better to use the Scannapieco approach. In Fig. 5 we present histograms of Jz / Jc (E ) (left column, star particles) and Jz / Jcirc (right column gas particles) for the CDM (bottom row) and WDM (top row) simulations. In the CDM simulation, gas in both the B and C clearly define a very thin disc, while A's gas is less ordered. Star particles on the other hand show a well defined disc in C's case, a "fat" disc in B's case and no disc in A's case In the WDM run, the gas particles of halo C appear to define a clear disc while halos A and B have poorer gaseous discs. With respect to the stars we see a similar situation to the CDM case. Halo C has a disc component, B has a thicker disc and A has no real disc. Due to the fact that halo A has a significative stellar bulge, the corresponding star particle histogram has been rescaled by a factor of four with respect to the stellar particle histogram of the other two galaxies, for both

the CDM and WDM runs (the peak of the star component of halo A was 20 in both runs). It is interesting to note that the discs of B and C are smaller in the WDM case than in the CDM case. This may again be a result of the delayed formation time of WDM haloes and the consequent lower mass. It is interesting that the bulge component (namely the peak at Jz / Jc (E ) = 0) seems to be roughly of the same size in both A and B. Note that the dip at Jz / Jcirc  1 in the gas distribution of A in the CDM simulation is due to a warping of the disc. C is the only galaxy that, owing to its quiet merger history, forms a clearly identifiable stellar disc, decomposed in Fig. 5 into bulge and disc components (see dashed lines). The total mass in each component is similar: In CDM, 44% and 56% of halo C's galaxy is attributed to a bulge and disc, respectively. These fractions are nearly perfectly inverted in WDM: 45% and 55% of halo C's stellar component are disc and bulge, respectively. Although our sample size is small, we note that one of the more unanticipated consequences of haloes forming later in WDM, is their smaller and thicker disc. Indeed this may simply be a reflection of the different dynamical environments of the two groups. More work on the relationship of disc thickness to DM particle mass is encouraged to see if one can constrain the other. Since the dynamical decomposition indicates that the galaxies within each halo differ substantially, it is perhaps no surprise that so too do their star formation histories. Although not shown here, the SFR (being a reflection of the merger history) is quantitatively very different in the two cosmologies. As expected (and seen elsewhere) our WDM sim-

ulation has far fewer satellites than our CDM simulation. WDM produces roughly the same number ( 20) of subhaloes as satellites observed to be in orbit about the Milky Way. However it is unclear if, owing to feedback and other star formation suppression mechanisms, WDM subhaloes are luminous enough to match the MW's satellite luminosity function.

It remains to be halo. seen if this is simply due to the unique dynamical history of this particular realization or if WDM generically As a result of the apparent failures of CDM in over and systematically produces thicker discs than CDM. producing and HDM in underproducing the number of dwarf satellites around the Milky Way, warm DM (WDM), has recently been suggested and studied (by e.g. Bode et al. 2001; Avila-Reese et al. 2001; Knebe et al. 2002, 2008; Acknowledgments Macci` o and Fontanot 2010; Lovell et al. 2011; Macci` o et al.

AK is supported by on a group of galaxies (i.e.	1Mpc). Within the scales the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci on (MICINN) that are still linear at z = 0 (the "local environment") in Spain through the Ramon y Cajal programme as well a group of galaxies that in CDM resembles the local as the grants AYA 2009-13875-C03-02, AYA2009-12792group (LG) is resimulated at high resolution, with gasC03-03, CSD2009-00064, and CAM S2009/ESP-1496 dynamics. In the CDM run, this local group includes and the Ministerio de Econom ia y Competitividad (MINECO) three galaxies that have the same mass, geometry and through grant AYA2012-31101. GY also acknowledges kinematics as the MW, M31 and M33. Thus our sim-

ulation allows us to study in detail the merger history and internal structure of these galaxies as well as their baryonic properties. Since the local environment has been kept identical, we can directly measure the effect the type of DM has on our CDM LG. The main difference between our CDM and WDM simulations is that structure formation is delayed in WDM. This is a direct result of the suppression of small scale power which, owing to the lack of mergers below the filtering mass, means that it takes longer for haloes to grow to a given mass. The greatest effect this has is to inhibit the collapse of a group of galaxies in WDM. All our results regarding the differences in the galaxies themselves, follow directly from this main difference.
