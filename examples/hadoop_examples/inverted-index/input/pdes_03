Abstract. In this paper, we consider the elliptic system $ & u " g px, vq in , v " f px, uq in , % u " v " 0 on B,

where  is a bounded smooth domain in RN , and f and g satisfy a general superquadratic condition. We prove the existence of infinitely many solutions. Our argument relies on the application of a generalized variant fountain theorem for strongly indefinite functionals. Previous results in the topic are improved.

1. Introduction In this paper, we study the existence of multiple solutions of certain superquadratic elliptic systems of the form $ & u " g px, v q in , v " f px, uq in , (S) % u " v " 0 on B ,

where  is a bounded smooth domain in RN , N  3, and the functions f, g :  ^ R  R are continuous and superlinear. Such systems describe steady state solutions of reaction-diffusion and hydrodynamical problems. The difficulties in studying (S) originate mainly in two facts. First, the associated energy functional is strongly indefinite, in the sense that it is neither bounded from above nor from below, even on a subspace of finite dimension or codimension. Therefore, the usual critical point theorems cannot be applied. Second, due to the growth conditions on f and g below, the energy functional associated with (S) is not defined on the 1 Sobolev space H0 pq. We will use fractional Sobolev spaces in order to apply variational methods. Elliptic systems leading to strongly indefinite functionals have been studied by many authors. See, for instance [1, 6, 5, 16, 3, 11, 4] and the references therein. In a recent paper [16], Szulkin and Weth considered (S) with f and g both subcritical and odd, and they assumed among others that the mappings u  f px, uq{|u| and u  g px, uq{|u| are strictly increasing in p8, 0qY p0, `8q. By developing a Nehari manifold method for strongly indefinite functionals, they obtained the existence of infinitely many solutions. We recall that if both f and g are subcritical, then the

Let the following set introduced by Pankov in [12]. ( M " w P E zE  | J 1 pwq, w " 0 and J 1 pwq, z " 0 " 0 @z P E  .

The argument in [16] relies on the observation that for every u P E zE	, the set E  ` R` u intersects M at exactly one point, namely m p puq. This allows the authors to reduce the problem on the manifold M, and then on the unit sphere S ` of E ` , where they can applied a classical multiplicity critical point theorem. If u  f px, uq{|u| or u  g px, uq{|u| is not strictly increasing in p8, 0q Y p0, `8q, then m p puq need not be unique, and their argument collapses. The main goal of this paper is to extend the result of [16] by considering more general growth conditions on f and g , and by only requiring the above mappings to be increasing. Our precise assumptions on f and g are the following. pH1 q f, g P C p ^ Rq and there is a constant C  0 such that for all px, uq, where p, q  2 satisfy |f px, uq|  C p1 ` |u|p q and |g px, uq|  C p1 ` |u|q q, 2 1 1 ` 1 . p q N 1 1 2   . q 2 N

Furthermore, in case N	5 we impose 1 1 2   p 2 N and

In [6], Hulshof and van der Vorst obtained the existence of at least one nontrivial solution of (S) by using the Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz's superquadraticy condition: D  2 and DR  0 such that 0	F px, uq  uf px, uq and 0  Gpx, uq  ug px, uq for |u|  R. (AR) This condition was mainly used to verify that the energy functional has a linking geometry in the sense of Benci and Rabinowitz [3], and also satisfies the PalaisSmale condition. A similar result was obtained by de Figueiredo and Felmer in [5]. We recall that (AR) implies f px, uq  c|u| and g px, uq  c|u| for |u|  R, hence it is stronger than pH3 q. As far as we know, Theorem 2 is new under assumptions pH1 q  pH5 q. It will be proved by using the generalized variant fountain theorem for strongly indefinite functionals, established by the author and Colin in [2]. This theorem combines the degree theory of Kryszewski and Szulkin [8], with the idea of the monotonicity trick developed by Jeanjean [7]. It also has the advantage that it produces bounded Palais-Smale sequences of the energy functional, and is not based on any reduction method. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contained the variational framework for the study of (S). The proof of Theorem 2 will be given in section 3. In section 4, we state a similar result concerning an indefinite semilinear elliptic equation. 2. Variational setting Consider the Laplacian as the operator

We refer to the paper of Persson [13] for the proof of the following lemma. Lemma 3. E s embeds continuously in Lr pq for s  0 and r  1 satisfying 1 1 s r  2  N . Moreover, the embedding is compact in the case of strict inequality.

By assumption pH1 q, there exist s, t  0 such that s ` t " 2 and 1 s 1 1 t 1   and   . p 2 N q 2 N We consider the functional	  As uAt vdx  F px, uq ` Gpx, v q dx, pu, v q P E s ^ E t . pu, v q :"

It follows from Lemma 3 that the inclusions E s  Lp pq and E t	Lq pq are continuous. This, together with the estimate	    As uAt vdx	|As u|2 |At u|2 " }u}s }v }t ,


imply that the functional  above is well defined on E :" E s ^ E t . Now a standard argument shows that if assumption pH1 q holds, then the functional	is of class C 1 on E . We say that pu, v q P E s ^ E t is a weak solution of (S) if	` s t  A uA k `As hAt v dx hf px, uq`kg px, v q dx " 0, @ph, k q P E s ^E t .


In order to recuperate from the critical points of the functional  (weak) solutions of (S), we need the following regularity result due to de Figueiredo and Felmer [5].

Lemma 4. If pu, v q P E s ^ E t is a weak solution of (S), then pu, v q is a strong solution of (S). We endow E " E s ^ E t with the inner product pu, v q, p, q

Since both E  and E ` are infinite-dimensional, the functional	is strongly indefinite, in the sense that it is neither bounded below nor above, even on subspaces of finite-dimension or finite-codimension. The study of  is therefore quite difficult, because the usual critical point theorems in [14, 17] cannot be applied directly. Now we present the generalized variant fountain theorem we will apply in order to prove our main result. Let Y be a closed subspace of a separable Hilbert space X endowed with the inner product ,  and the associated norm }  }. We denote by P : X  Y and Q : X	Z :" Y K the orthogonal projections.

Clearly, we can define an equivalent inner product in X with associated norm }	} such that  `	1 1 |u|2  u2 dx " }Qu}2  }P u}2 , 2 2  where P : X  Y and Q : X  Z are the orthogonal projections. The functional  above then reads  1 1 puq " }Qu}2  }P u}2  F px, uqdx. 2 2  Let  "1 i 1 }Qu}2   }P u}2 ` F px, uqdx ,  P r1, 2s. 2 2  Evidently, we can equipped pX, }  }q with the	topology, and it is easy to check that	is  upper semicontinuous and that 1  is weakly sequentially continuous. The rest of the proof uses an argument similar to that in the proof of Theorem 2, which is now simplified since dimY  8.  puq "

Remark 12. Theorem 11 extends Theorem 3.2 in [15], where the mapping u	f px, uq{|u| was supposed to be strictly increasing in Rzt0u. References
