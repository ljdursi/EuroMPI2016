SOLITON RESOLUTION FOR EQUIVARIANT WAVE MAPS TO THE SPHERE
RAPHAL CTE

arXiv:1305.5325v1 [math.AP] 23 May 2013

Abstract. We consider finite energy corotationnal wave maps with target manifold S2 . We prove that for a sequence of times, they decompose as a sum of decoupled harmonic maps in the light cone, and a smooth wave map (in the blow case) or a linear scattering term (in the global case), up to an error which tends to 0 in the energy space.

1. Introduction 1.1. Statement of the main results. Let (M, g ) be a Riemannian manifold, and R1+d be endowed with the Minkowski metric  = diag(-1, 1, . . . , 1). Wave maps U : (R1+d ,  )  (M, g ) are defined formally as critical points of the Lagrangian 1    U,	U g dxdt. L (U, U ) = 2 R1+d In local coordinates, they satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation (1.1)
i j U k = -  k ij (U ) U  U (U, t U )|t=0 = (U0 , U1 ),

where k ij are the Christoffel symbols on T M . We refer to the review article [17] and the reference therein for recent developments regarding general wave maps. We consider the case where d = 2 and M is a 2 dimensional surface of revolution with metric ds2 = d2 + g ()2 d, where (, ) are the polar coordinates on M , and g  C 3 (R). We assume that U has corotationnal equivariant symmetry, that is, denoting (r,  ) the polar coordinates on R2 , it takes the form U (t, r,  ) = ( (t, r),  ). for some function	. System (1.1) then simplifies to the following equation on  :	f ( ) 1  tt  - rr  - r	+ 2 = 0 (WM) where f = gg . r r (,   )| = ( ,  )
t t=0 0 1

We say that such a solution  = (, t  ) to (WM) is a wave map. We define the energy space H  L2 and similarly the Hilbert space H  L2 as follows: given a couple of function  = (0 , 1 ), and for 0 r1 < r2 ,

We omit r1 , r2 in the case r1 = 0 and r2 = : the energy is E () := E (; 0, ), and H  L2 = { | E () < +}. If  = ( (t), t  (t)) is a finite energy wave map, then at least formally its energy is preserved: for all t where defined, (1.2) E ( (t)) = E ( (0)).

(WM) is energy critical in the following sense. Consider the scaling (for  > 0) [](t, r) := 0 t r ,   1 , 1  t r ,   .

Then  is a wave map if and only if [] is a wave map, and the energy is scaling invariant: E ( ) = E ([]). Notice that the H  L2 norm is also scaling invariant. Recall that if	 H , then  continuous and bounded, and has well defined limits at 0 and +, which cancel g : we denote them (0) and (). If  is a wave map, these limits do not depend on time. This motivates the introduction of the set of points where g vanishes V := {  R | g ( ) = 0}. Also, let

We recall the local well-posedness result in the energy space, due to Shatah and Tahvildar-Zadeh. Theorem ([23]). Let (0 , 1 )	H  L2 . Then there exists a unique wave map  = (, t  )	C (I, H  L2 ) solution to (WM), defined on a maximal interval I =: (T - ( ), T + ( )), and which preserves the energy (1.2). The wave map equation (WM) has been intensively studied as a model for geometric wave equations. It has been long understood that the geometry of the target M , i.e. the metric g , plays a crucial role in the long time behavior of wave maps. Let us mention the result by Struwe [25]: a wave map that blows up in finite time must bubble up a harmonic map at blow up time. In particular, if M does not admit non constant harmonic maps, then any wave map is global in time. Actual examples of wave maps blowing up in finite time were constructed by Rodnianski and Sterbenz [22] and Raphal and Rodnianski [21] (as a perturbation of the self similar regime), and by Krieger, Schlag and Tataru [19] (with prescribed, polynomial blow up rate). On a different side, together with Kenig, Lawrie and Schlag [6, 7], we classified the asymptotic behavior of wave maps with energy less than 3 times the energy of a harmonic map, for large time or near blow up time. Our goal in this paper is to obtain a similar classification for wave maps of arbitrarily large energy, that is to relax the bound on the energy. We provide a description of a wave map into decoupled profiles, a so called soliton resolution.

It turns out that these profiles are harmonic maps and linear scattering terms. Recall that a harmonic map is a solution Q of finite energy of 1 f (Q) rr Q + r Q = 2 . r r (Hence (Q, 0) is a finite energy stationary wave map). From [4], they are classified as follows: a non constant harmonic map is monotonic, satisfies one of the ODEs rr Q = g (Q) or rr Q = -g (Q), and joins two consecutive points of V , that is for some , m  V , {Q(0), Q()} = { , m} and V  ( , m) = . It has energy E (Q) := E (Q, 0) = 2(G(m) - G( )). In particular if V = 1, there exists no non constant harmonic map (if V is empty, there is no finite energy map). On the other hand, given  V , we define the linearized wave map flow around : (LW ) g ( )2 1  = 0. tt  - rr  - r  + r r2 g ( )2 (t, r)2 r2 < m,

Solutions to this linear wave equation preserve the following H  L2 related quantity (t)

We now state the main result of this paper. For this, we make the following assumptions on the metric g : (A1) G(x)   as x  . (A2) V is discrete, (A3) For all	V , g ( )  {-1, 1}. Assumption (A1) prevents the formation of bubbles at infinity, and is a very natural assumption. (A2) is also a natural assumption of non degeneracy of g , which prevent a decomposition with harmonic maps of arbitrarily small energy. The physically relevant metrics g are (1) g () = sin() (wave maps to the sphere S2 ), and (2) g () = 1 - 2 (radial 4D Yang-Mills equation). Hence (A3) allows to handle wave maps to the sphere S2 ; however, dealing with the radial 4D Yang-Mills equation requires to relax (A3) to (A3') For all  V , g ( )  {-2, -1, 1, 2}. It should be noted that most of the results in this article hold under (A3') instead of (A3). One could even consider the natural condition g (V )  Z \ {0}, which makes the linearized problem (LW ) around to be of wave type (in dimension 2g ( ) + 2). However large g ( ) raise technical issues for the Cauchy problem as noted in [5, Theorem 2], which is restricted to the case (A3'); if these issues could be dealt with, most results here hold under this last condition. Theorem 1.1. We make assumptions (A1)-(A2)-(A3). Let  (t) be a finite energy wave map. Then there exist a sequence of time tn  T + ( ), an integer J 0, J sequences of scales J,n  2,n 1,n and J harmonic maps Q1 , . . . , QJ such that QJ (0) =  (0), and that the following holds.

and

E (Qj ) + E (). This gives a bound on J .

Also, if T + ( ) = +, then J #(V  [ (0),  ()]) - 1. This last number can be made arbitrarily large when V is infinite (as for g = sin). Remark 2. The question whether the decomposition holds for all times and not merely for a sequence is open. However there are some cases where it can be proved. For example, when the excess energy of  with respect to the energy to connect	(0) to	() is not enough to bubble more harmonic maps: that is E ( ) < 2|G( ()) - G( (0))| + 4, where  = min V \{(0),()} {|G( ( )) - G( (0))|, |G( ( ) - G( ())|}. We refer to [6, Proof of Theorem 1.3] for a detailed argument in the case J = 1. Remark 3. Many possibilities are left open regarding the behavior of the j,n : for example, in the global case, one could have J,n	0 (infinite time blow-up), or J,n  + (infinite time flattening). Although no such solutions were constructed for (WM), let us refer to [9] in the context of the semilinear wave equation. Theorem 1.1 is an extension of [6, 7] where only one profile was allowed (i.e J = 1) through the bound on the energy. It is in the spirit of the seminal papers by Duyckaerts, Kenig and Merle [10, 11, 12, 13] where large solutions of the radial energy critical (focusing) wave equation in 3D were described. Let us however observe that their analysis did not encompass type I blow up solutions (i.e when lim suptT + (u) u(t) H  1 L2 = +). This phenomenon does not occur in the wave map case (mainly because the energy is coercive, even if it doesn't bound H  L2 ), and we give a description of any wave map, without any further assumption. 1.2. Outline of the proof. Let us mention two delicate issues. First, geometry has to be taken into account: the harmonic maps do never belong to H  L2 . This means we must derive a procedure to extract them without relying on a linear profile decomposition, as for the wave equation. Second, the linearized operator of the wave map flow at spatial infinity is of wave type in even dimension: most of the delicate linear estimates available in the radial 3D case break down for wave maps, in particular the so-called "energy channels". When g ( ) is odd, (LW ) corresponds to a wave equation in Rd with d	0 mod 4, and the linear estimate obtained in [8] in this case suffices to conclude. When g ( ) is even, then d	2 mod 4 and the desired linear estimate fails. This is the reason why we must restrict ourselves to (A3) instead of (A3').

The first step in the proof is to choose a sequence of time tn	T + ( ) on which the space-time kinetic energy inside the light cone vanishes. This is a reformulation that the averaged kinetic energy inside the light cone vanishes, which is a well known result, and is the content of Section 2.1. Section 2.2 focuses on various aspects of the profile decomposition in H  L2 to be used later in the paper. The second step, Section 3, is concerned with sequence of wave maps whose spacetime kinetic energy vanishes, and shows, in Theorem 3.3, that up to a subsequence, one can construct a bubble decomposition i.e extract the harmonic maps. This decomposition holds up to an error which tends to 0 in L . Notice that this result does not make use of assumption (A3) or (A3'), but only (A1) and (A2). The bound on the error is insufficient to capture the linear scattering term for example, but it is enough to derive a sharp scattering theorem below the threshold in L . As linear scattering is involved, we do need assumption (A3') here. This result has its own interest: let us state it here, and postpone the proof to Section 4. For  V , define d as the distance of to the closest (distinct) element in V : d = inf {| - k | | k  V \ { }}. d > 0 due to assumption (A2). Theorem 1.2. Let	V and assume (A1)-(A2), and g ( )  {-2, -1, 1, 2}. Let	be a wave map such that  () = , and that for some c <  , (1.5) t  [0, T + ( )),  (t) -

Then T + ( ) = + and  scatters at +, in the sense -

(S is an adequate Strichartz space, defined below on (2.4)). It follows that there exists a (unique) solution L to (LW ) such that  (t) - ( , 0) - L (t)

Remark 4. Observe that if g vanishes in at most one point , then d = +, and so Theorem 1.2 proves that all wave maps are global and scatter in this case. This strengthens the global well posedness result by Struwe [25] mentioned above. As a consequence of Theorem 1.2, we can extract the scattering term (for all times, not merely a sequence) in the global case. In an analogous way, we can define the regular part	in the blow up case. This is the content of Propositions 5.1 and 5.2 of Section 5. Let us emphasize that this step only requires (A3'). In Section 6, we revisit Theorem 3.3. Under the additional assumption (A3)  crucial but used only on this step, we show that the error term tends to 0 in H  L2 . This section is independent of Sections 4 and 5. Finally, we gather all the previous results together in Section 7 and prove of Theorem 1.1. 2. Preliminaries The purpose of this section is to recall or adapt a few important earlier results, and derive some consequences. 2.1. The self-similar region.

2.1.1. Global wave maps. Throughout this Subsection, let  be a finite energy wave map such that T + ( ) = +. Proposition 2.1 ([7, Proposition 2.1]). For all  > 0, lim sup E ( (t); t, t - A)  0

Proof. The argument in [7] is done for g = sin, after ideas of [3], and extends seamlessly for any non linearity g . We derive a few consequences from this. One fundamental outcome of Proposition 2.1 is that the kinetic part of the energy vanishes in an averaging sense. More precisely, we have: Corollary 2.2 ([7, Corollary 2.2]). lim sup

From there, we find a sequence of times for which the condition (3) in Theorem 3.3 holds. Corollary 2.3. There exists a sequence tn  + such that sup

Fix A and T0 2A be large enough such that for all T T0 , 1 T f (t)dt   T A T +s(T ) 1  there exists s(T )  [0, T /2] such that f (t)dt s(T ) T -s(T )

40 .

Consider the sets (T - s(T ), T + s(T )) for T	[T0 , 2T0 ]. Their diameter is bounded by 2T0 , hence Vitaly covering lemma applies: there exist a sequence (T n )n such that the intervals (T n - s(T n ), T n + s(T n )) are disjoints and [T0 , 2T0 ]  (T - s(T ), T + s(T ))
T [T0 ,2T0 ] n

From this last condition, it follows that T0 10

On the other hand, by definition of the s(T n ), we get that

Proof. The argument in [7] is done for g = sin and can be extended seamlessly for any non linearity g . 2.1.2. Blow up wave maps. Throughout this Subsection, let  be a finite energy wave map such that T + ( ) < +. The results here very similar to those in the global case, and in fact simpler (integration can be done up to the light cone). Proposition 2.5 ([24, Lemma 2.2]). For all   (0, 1), E ( (t); (T + ( ) - t), T + ( ) - t)	0 Corollary 2.6 ([24, Corollary 2.2]). 1 T + ( ) - T

Assume that the conclusion fails, for the sake of contradiction: then there exists  > 0 and a function s defined on [T + ( ) - , T + ( )) such that 0 s(T ) T + ( ) - T and (2.1) 1 s(T )
T +s(T )

f (t)dt

Corollary 2.6 yields T0 < T + ( ) such that for all T  [2T0 - T + ( ), T + ( )), (2.2) 1 T + ( ) - T
T + ( )

We apply Vitali covering lemma to the intervals (T - s(T ), T + s(T )) where T	[T0 , T + ( )) to find a sequence T n such that (T n - s(T n ), T n + s(T n )) are disjoints and [T0 , T + ( ))  (T n - 5s(T n ), T n + 5s(T n )). Hence taking the length: T + ( ) - T0 10

s(T n ).

Therefore, as the interval are disjoint, and using (2.1),
T + ( ) T n +s(T n )

f (t)dt

f (t)dt

4 (T + ( ) - T0 ).

Now T ( ) - (2T0 - 1) = 2(T ( ) - T0 ), and we reached a contradiction with (2.2). 2.2. Energy concentration on the light cone for (LW ). For the rest of this Subsection, we fix  V and focus on the linear equation (LW ). We define the transformation T defined by (T )(r) = (r)/rg ( ) . Then  is a solution of (LW ) if and only if  = (T , T t ) solves the radial wave equation in 2 + 2g ( ) dimensions: (2.3) Observe that

The norms H and H are equivalent. It follows that T is a bicontinuous bijective  1 (r1+2g ( ) dr). linear map L2 (rdr)	L2 (r1+2g ( ) dr) and H  H We start by recalling a result regarding equipartition of energy and concentration of energy on the light cone for linear solutions.

Proof. The first statement is the content of [8, Theorem 4]. The second is equipartition of the energy, and is classical for the linear wave equation. We will sometimes use, in the context of a profile decomposition, the following weaker form, namely all the energy concentrates on one scale. Corollary 2.9. Let  be a solution to (LW ), and (tn , n ) be two sequences with n > 0, and such that |tn |  + . n

Then for any c > 1, as n  +,  - tn r , n j,n , 1 j,n t	- tn r , n j,n	(0)

Now we recall a result giving some condition so that some energy of a linear solution remains outside of the light cone. It was already crucial in [6, 7]. Here is the only place in the argument where we need to restrict to odd g ( ) (and hence (A3) to have the nonlinear argument run). Proposition 2.10 ([8, Theorem 1]). Assume g ( ) is an odd integer. There exists  ( ) > 0 such that the following holds. Let  be a solution to (LW ), such that t (0) = 0. Then for all t	R, (t)

Proof. As mentioned, this is an easy consequence of [8, Theorem 1] and the remark that follows. We refer to [6, Corollary 2.3] for the complete argument to pass from the linear wave equation to (LW ). 2.3. Profile decomposition for (LW ) in H  L2 . Again, we fix	V for the rest of this subsection. Our goal is to derive a suitable notion of linear profile decomposition in the spirit of [1], adapted to our setting, in particular L bounds. Using transformation T , a notion of profile decomposition for the wave equation will immediately translate to a similar decomposition for (LW ), but we will in fact improve it. We elaborate on this in what follows. For I an interval of R, we define

Notice that	(t) H L2 is bounded t (R,Lr ) below and above by  (0) H L2 (because it is equivalent to the conserved quantity	(t) H L2 ). It follows that for some K only depending on , M KA. As all the functional space under consideration are invariant under scaling and time translation, we can assume that | (0, 1)| 2M/3. Let s, t	R, and r q 0. Then for any   [q, r] we have

From this, the profile decomposition for (LW ) takes the following form. Theorem 2.12 (Profile decomposition). Let n a bounded sequence of H  L2 .

(with the convention that the sup is 0 if J0 is empty). Proof. This is essentially contained in [1, Main Theorem]. We refer to [6, Corollary 2.15] for the profile decomposition in the wave map context and the Pythagorean expansion of the H  L2 norm, and to [6, Lemma 2.16] for the Pythagorean expansion of the energy. The only extra points with respect to the usual profile decomposition are J,n

and the L profile selection. For the former, the Pythagorean expansion ensures that J,n (0) H L2 is a bounded sequence, hence this follows from the previous Lemma and lim sup J,n S (R)  0.

For the latter, let rn such that 1 . n First assume lim inf n n L > 0, and let	> 0 such that 2 < lim inf n n L . Choose J so large that J,n L	for n large enough. Then consider j J . If t,r |n (rn ) - n

This shows that lim sup n

For the reverse inequality, first notice that as j  +, Vj (0) H  0 (due to the Pythagorean expansion of the energy), and so Vj (0) L  0. Hence there exists j0 such that sup { Vj (0) L | j J, j  J0 } = Vj0 L . Also, as Vj0 (0) is continuous and tend to 0 at 0 and +, there exists r0 > 0 such that |Vj0 (0, r0 )| = sup { Vj (0) L | j  J0 } .

Again due to orthogonality of the profiles, we see that lim inf n

If lim inf n n L = 0, then choosing a subsequence such that (n)  0 in L , and arguing as previously, we see that J0 = . Therefore n - J,n L  0 for all J , and so n L  0. The desired equality also holds in this case. Proposition 2.13 (Pythagorean expansion with cut-off, [8, Corollary 8]). We use the notation of the previous Proposition. Fix J 1 and Let 0 rn sn + be two sequences. Then we have the expansion: n

Proof. This is the content of [8, Corollary 8]. The proof there is done for one sequence i.e. rn = 0. To derive the above expansion, it suffices to do the difference between the expansions with cut-off r sn and r rn . We will use several times the following simple remark. Corollary 2.14. Let n be a bounded sequence in H  L2 . Assume furthermore that 0,n L  0 and 1,n L2  0. Denote n,L the linear evolution (to (LW )) with data n at time 0, then n,L
S (R)

Proof. It suffices to prove that any profile decomposition has no non-trivial profiles. Consider such a decomposition with profiles (Vj,L )j and parameters (tj,n , j,n ), and remainder J,n . Recall equipartition of the energy: if |tj,n |/j,n  +, then 1 j,n t Vj - tj,n j,n

2 H L 2 .

Hence, from Pythagorean expansion of the energy, it follows that all non-trivial profile Vj,L must satisfy tj,n = 0 and t Vj,L (0) = 0. But as n L  0, equality (2.5) shows that Vj,L (0) L = 0, hence Vj,L = 0 and Vj,L = 0. Therefore, all profiles Vj,L are trivial, and n is the remainder term J,n (which does not depend on J ), which satisfy the desired dispersion property. We recall the notion of nonlinear profile. If V is a solution of the linear equation (LW ) and T	R, there exists a unique wave map U solution to (WM), defined on a neighborhood of T and satisfying U (0) = U () = and U (t) - V (t) - ( , 0)
H L2

 0 as t  T.

Notice that if T = +, then U is defined on some interval [T0 , +) and scatters at +, i.e U - S ([T0 ,+)) < +. This notion follows from local well posedness [5, Theorem 2]; we refer to [15, 16] for further details.

Proposition 2.15 (Evolution of the decomposition). Let n be a sequence of wave maps such that (n (0) - ( , 0))n admits a profile decomposition in the sense of Theorem 2.12, from which we use the notations. Denote Uj nonlinear profiles associated to Vj , - limn J 1, tn - tj,n < T + (Uj ), j,n and sup Uj -

Proof. It is the translation of [10, Proposition 2.8] via the transformation T . Notice that n (0) - ( , 0))n is a bounded sequence in H  L2 , in particular n (0) = n () = . Let us emphasize that we can not evolve a decomposition where harmonic maps appear: this is a fundamental difference with the semi linear wave  1  L2 ). equation, where such stationary profile were allowed (they belong to H We will often use this result in the following particular case. Corollary 2.16. Let n be a sequence of wave maps such that n () = n (0) = , and (1) n (0) - ( , 0) is a bounded sequence in H  L2 . (2) If n,L denotes the linear solution to (LW ) with initial data n (0) - ( , 0), then n,L S (R)  0. Then for n large enough n is defined globally on R and sup n (t) - ( , 0) - n,L (t)

Remark 5. Notice we can combine Corollary 2.14 with this last result, as the hypothesis of the latter are the conclusions given by the former. Proof. The second condition means that any profile decomposition is trivial (i.e) does not contain any non trivial profile. Hence with the notation of the previous Proposition, n (0) - ( , 0) = J,n (0) =: n,L (0) (does not depend on J ) and n (t) + ( , 0) = n,L (t) + rn (t). To conclude, we argue by contradiction: (1) if n blow-up in finite time, consider tn = T + (n ) + 1 (and similarly for T - (n )). (2) if the convergence does not hold, there exists  > 0 and tn be such that rn (tn ) H L2	. Each hypothesis contradicts Proposition 2.15.

3. Bubble decomposition for a sequence of wave maps Our goal here is to study a sequence of wave maps with vanishing (space-time) kinetic energy. First we prove that at any scale, there is local (strong) limit which is a harmonic map (possibly constant). Proposition 3.1 (Profile at any scale). We assume (A1)-(A2). Let A > 0 and n be wave maps be defined on the time interval [-A, A], such that (1) n have uniformly bounded energy E (n ) (2) n (0) is bounded. (3) For some sequence rn  +, t n

Then (n) , up to a subsequence	(n), converges to some harmonic map (Q, 0) locally strongly in the following sense: for any R > 0, (3.1) sup

Remark 6. Assume furthermore that for some sequences tn  [-A, A] and rn  r  (0, +), (n) (tn , rn )  l. It follows from the convergence that Q(r ) = l, hence from classification of harmonic maps, Q is non constant if and only if g (l) = 0. Remark 7. A result of this type was already obtained in [25], but only for the 2 first scale (and in the L2 loc (H  L ([0, +)loc ) topology), i.e. under the additional assumption that sup E (n ; 0, 1) 0 .

It follows that  satisfies the wave map equation (WM) in a weak sense, and has finite energy E ( ) lim inf n E (n ). Now, as t n L2 ((-1,1),L2 (r rn ))  0, then for all R 0, t  L2 ((-1,1),L2 (r R)) = 0, and hence t	= 0, that is  is a weak harmonic map: rr (rr  ) = f ( ). It follows by elliptic regularity that  = (Q, 0) a smooth harmonic map. Let us prove as a first step that there holds strong local convergence in space-time 2 L2 loc ((-1, 1), H  L )loc ). Let K be a compact of (-1, 1)  (0, +) (in space time). Then (3.2) n (t, r) -  (t, r)

Then for all k  -K, K - 1 , there exist tk  [k/K, (k + 1)/K ] such that tk  P . Let  > 0 be provided by the previous Lemma 3.2 with T = 1 (and our previously fixed  > 0). Define N be such that k  -K, K - 1 , n Let t  [-1, 1] and n Hence by 3.2 (as 1/K Now R + 1 - 1/K N, n (tk ) - (Q, 0)

Theorem 3.3 (Bubble decomposition). We assume (A1)-(A2). Let (n )n  C ([-1, 1], H	L2 ) be a sequence of wave maps.

Also notice that due to monotonicity of the energy along light cones, hypothesis (2) and (4) are in fact uniform in t  [-1, 1]. More precisely, there holds (2') for all r > 0, supt[-1,1] n (t) - L ([r,R])  0 as n  +. (4') for all r > 0, supt[-1,1] E (n (t); r, R)  0 as n  + Let us prove (4') first. Let r > 0 and  > 0.

We now define the set of scales S made of couples  := ((rn )n , ) where (rn )n  [0, R]N , such that (3.3) (n) (0, rn ) has a limit l such that |g (l )| = 0 . We denote by S0 the subset of S made of scales ((rn )n , ) such that for some non constant harmonic map Q, it satisfies furthermore (3.4) A > 0, (n) (0) - (Q(rn ), 0)

~ := ((r(n) )n ,    )  S0 , we say it is adapted to   S , and Notice that the scale  ~. we call Q the local limit at scale  We now proceed with the extraction of the profiles. First assume that S0 is empty. In this case, let us prove that for n large enough, g (n (0))  0 . Indeed, recall that g (n (0, R))  0. If there exist an extraction  such that for all n, g ((n) (0))  > 0 , then by continuity of g ((n) )(0), for all n there exist rn such that |g ((n) )(0, rn )| = 0 . As g -1 ({0 })  [-K, K ] is compact, up to extracting a subsequence, we can assume that g ((n) )(0, rn )  where |g ( )| = 0 . Hence ((rn )n ,  )  S and we saw at the previous paragraph how to construct an adapted scale to it: it follows that S0 = , a contradiction. Hence for n N , g (n (0)) Then we choose J = 0 and bn = n . If S0 is not empty, we proceed by induction and construct a (finite) sequence of scales j = (rj,n )n , j )  S0 for j = 1, . . . J , such that (1) There exist an extraction j such that j +1 = j  j . rj +1,n  0 as n  +. (2) Orthogonality: rj,j+1 (n) (3) For j  1, J - 1 and all n  N and r  (rj +1,n , 0 rj,j (n) ), there holds |g (j+1 (n) (0, r))| < 0 . (4) For all r  [0, 0 rJ,J (n) ), |g (J (n) (0, r))| < 0 . The first two conditions give an order on S0 , the third one ensures that the scale j and j +1 are "consecutive", and the fourth one is the stopping condition. Let 1 be an extraction such that for all n	N, g (1 (n) (0)) L ([0,R]) 0 . We can furthermore choose 1 such that 1 (n) (r1,n ) has a limit l1  g -1 ({0 }), where r1,n is defined as follows: r1,n is such that |g (n (r1,n )| = 0 and r  (r1,n , R], |g (n (0, r))| < 0 . 1 and r1,n are well defined because n is continuous, g (n (R))  0 and S0 is not empty. Then (r1,n , 1 )	S , and let 1 be adapted. This yields the first scale 1 := ((r1,1 (n) )n , 1  1 )  S0 , and Q1 is the local limit at scale 1 . Now assume that (rj,n )n , j ) is constructed. For some non constant harmonic map Qj we have the convergence A > 0, j (n) (0) - (Qj (rj,n ), 0))
H L2 (rj,n /A,Arj,n )

0 .

 0 as n  +.

For A 2, the convergence also holds in L (rj,n /A, Arj,n ), due to Lemma A.2. Now, as |g (Qj (0 ))| 0 /2, we see (with A = 1/0 ) that for large n, |g (j (n) (0, 0 rj,n ))| 2/3. If for n large enough, sup{|g (j (n) (0, r)| | r  [0, 0 rj,n ]} 0 , we stop here. Otherwise, we construct (~ rj +1,n )n , j +1 ) as follows. First choose an extraction j such that denoting j +1 = j	j , we have n, sup |g (j+1 (n) (0, r))| > 0 .
r [0,0 rj,j (n) ]

This allows to define r ~j +1,n such that |g (j+1 (n) (0, r ~j +1,n )| = 0 and r  (~ rj +1,n , 0 rj,j (n) ),
19

|g (j+1 (n) (r)| < 0 .

Extracting further, we can assume without loss of generality that j+1 (n) (0, r ~j +1,n ) has a limit lj +1 , i.e. (~ rj +1,n )n , j +1 )  S . Notice that due to the local convergence j (j (n)) (0)) - (Qj (rj,j (n) ), 0) on the scale rj,n , it follows that r ~j +1,n  0 as n  +. rj,j (n) Let finally choose an extraction j adapted such that (rj +1,n )n , j +1 )  S0 , where j +1 := j +1  j and rj +1,n := r ~j +1, j (n) . Finally let Qj +1 be the local limit at scale (rj +1,n , j +1 ). Then j := j  j is an extraction such that j +1 = j  j . Also, we see that r ~j +1, rj +1,n = rj,j (n) rj,j (
j (n) j (n))

 0 as n  +.

Finally, by the definition of r ~j,+1,n , we have r  (rj +1,n , 0 rj,j (n) ), Hence (rj +1,n )n , j +1 ) is as desired. Notice that from our construction, we have Qj +1 () = Qj (0). We know claim that this process has to stop after a finite number of steps. Indeed, fix J 1 consider the sequence (J (n) )n . Then for 1 j J , we have for all A > 0, E (j (n) ; 1/Arj j (n),j , Arj J (n),j )  E (Qj , 0; 1/A, A). Now for j < j , if we denote rj = j	   j -1 , and  = j	k r(n),j = 0 rj k (n),j r (n),j
k (n),j (n),j

|g (j+1 (n) (r)| < 0 .

due to the fact that the scales rn,j and r Summing this for 1 j J , we thus get E lim inf E (k (n) )
n

are orthogonal.

J

E (Qj , 0; 1/A, A).
j =1

Letting A  +, we get E j , we have that E (Qj , 0)

J j =1

E (Qj , 0). As Qj (0), Qj ()  [-K, K ] for all

EK := inf {G(k ) - G(k ) | k, k  V  [-K, K ], k > k }. JEK and this prove that the process

EK > 0 due to assumption (A2). Hence E has to stop after at most E/EK steps.

Thus we have constructed a sequence of J scales (r1,n , 1 ), . . . , (rJ,n , J )  S0 and of non constant harmonic maps Qj . We can now define for j = 1, . . . J ,  = J , It will be convenient to write 0,n = R, J +1,n = 0.
20

j,n = rj,j+1 J (n)

From our construction, we have that for all j = 1, . . . , J , and A > 0, sup

Also, for all n  N and j = 0, . . . , J , j +1,n (3.6)	0 as n	+ j,n (3.7) g ((n) (0)) L ([j+1,n /0 ,0 j,n ]) Define the error term: for t  [-1, 1]

(3.8)

bn (t) = (n) (t) - ( , 0) -

(Qj (/j,n ) - Qj ()x, 0).

Step 2 : Convergence at all scales. Let A > 0 and a sequence n	[0, R/A] be given. We now prove conclusion (1), that is (3.9) sup
t[-An ,An ]

bn (t)

H L2 ([n /A,An ])

 0 as n  +.

This means that bn has no profile in the cone CA . First let us prove (3.10) bn (0) bn (0)
L ([0,R])

 0 as n  +

From assumption (4), for all A > 0,
H L2 (R/A r R)

 0 as n  +.

And it follows that from Step 1 and an easy induction that for all j = 1, . . . , J , and A > 0, bn (0) H L2 (j,n /A r Aj,n )  0 as n  +. Hence due to Lemma A.2, bn (0)
L (R/A r R)

+ bn (0)

L (rj,n /A r Aj,n )

 0 as n  +.

We now argue by contradiction. Let rn  [0, R] be such that lim supn |bn (0, rn )| > 0. From convergence on the scales j,n of bn (0), we have that j = 0, . . . J, j,(n) r(n) +	+. j,(n) r(n) r(n) j0 ,n .

We can assume that for some extraction , and for some j0  0, J , j0 +1,n For j j0 , Qj (r(n) /j,n )  Qj (0) = Qj +1 () and for j > j0 , Qj (r(n) /j,n )  Qj () = Qj -1 (0), hence
J j0

Qj (r(n) /j,n ) - Qj ()
j =1 j =1

Qj +1 () - Qj () = Qj0 (0) - Q1 ().

Now, as Q1 () = , we deduce that bn (0, r(n) ) = (n) (rn ) - Qj0 (0) + on (1). Up to extracting further we can assume, (recall bn (0) is continuous and bn (0, R)  0), b(n) (0, r(n) ) = ,
21

where  = 0 is small so that we also have g ( + Qj0 (0)) = 0. It follows that (n) (0, rn )) = b(n) (0, r(n) ) + Qj0 (0) + on (1)   + Qj0 (0). Arguing as in Step 1, (and relying on Proposition 3.1), we deduce that there exist a harmonic map Q such that Q(1) = Qj0 (0) +  (in particular, Q is not constant) and and extraction such that A > 0,
(n) (0)

-Q

H L2 ([r

But then convergence also holds in L and as g (Q) lim inf g ((n) (0))

L ([j0 +1,n ,j0 ,n ])

and we reached a contradiction with (3.7). This proves that for all sequences (rn )n  [0, R], limn bn (0, rn ) = 0, and hence bn (0) which is (3.10). We now prove (3.9) arguing by contradiction. Up to extracting a subsequence, we can assume without loss of generality the existence of A > 0 and of a sequences tn such that 0 |tn | An AR, and for some	0 and  > 0 tn  . bn (tn ) H L2 (n /A r An ) , and n Also (2) and (4) show that tn , n  0 as n  +. Similarly, due to (3.5), for all j = 0, . . . , J , n j,n +  . j,n n Up to extracting further we can assume that there is j0	0, J such that for all n, j0 +1,n Now consider the wave map n (t, r) = (n) (n t, n r). By inspection, n is a finite energy wave map defined for times t  [-A, A], and for n large enough, (3.11) and 1 A

Hence for some harmonic map Q, n  Q in the sense of Proposition 3.1. Q is not constant due to (3.11). Unscaling, we have R, sup

bn (t) - (Q(/n ), 0)

H L2 ([n /A,An ])

But then, for any t  [-An , An ], bn (t, n )  Q(1) = 0 as n  +: this contradicts (3.10). Hence (3.9) is proved. Notice that it follows immediately from (3.9) and Lemma A.2 that (3.12) sup{|bn (t, r)| | 0 r R, 0 |t|
22

min{1, Ar}}  0 as n  +.

As bn (0)

L ([0,R])

 0, and (n) (0)  V , we see that for n large enough, (n) (0) = QJ (0) =: l.

Up to dropping the first terms of the sequence, we can assume that this holds for all n. Then (3.8) can be rewritten
J

(3.13)

bn (t) = n (t) - (l, 0) -
j =1

(Qj (/j,n ) - Qj (0), 0).

Step 3: (Convergence up to the last scale) We do the proof for J 1, the proof in the case J = 0 being completely similar. Fix A > 0, we now prove that (3.14) sup
t[-AJ,n ,AJ,n ]

bn (t)

H L2 ([0,AJ,n ])

From Step 2, we know that there exists n  + such that sup

bn (t)

H L2 ([J,n /n ,n J,n ])

 0.

Let us first prove that (3.15) E ((n) (0); 0; n J,n )  0.

We argue by contradiction. If the above convergence does not holds, there exists  > 0 and a subsequence that we still denote (n) such that for some n J,n /n , we have E ((n) (0); 0; 2n ) =  > 0. By decreasing  > 0 if necessary, we can furthermore assume that (3.16) x  R, |G(x) - G(l)| /2 = |f (x) - f (l)(x - l)| f (l)|x - l| . 2

(we recall that l := QJ (0)  V , so that f (l) = 0 and f (l) = g (l)2 > 0). By monotonicity of the energy, we see that for t  [-n , n ], E ((n) (t); 0; n ) Let un (t, r) = ((n) (n t, n r), n t (n) (n t, n r)). Then un (t, r) is a wave map defined on the time interval [-1, 1], and for all t  [-1, 1], (3.17) E (un (t); 0; 1)  and E (un (t); 0; 3) .  and E ((n) (t); 0; 3n ) .

The definition of  shows that for all t  [-1, 1], r  [0, 1] (3.18) |f (un (t, r)) - f (l)(un (t, r) - l)| f (l)|un (t, r) - l| . 2

Also the condition (3) yields
1 R/n

(3.19)
-1 0

|t un (t, r)|2 rdrdt  0.
L ([0,J,n /(n n ))

This allows to apply Proposition 3.1. As un (0) - QJ (0) local limit is constant, i.e. for all B > 0, (3.20) sup
t[-1,1] 23

 0, the

un (t) - (l, 0)

Let  : R  R be an even cutoff function such that (x) = 1 for |x| (x) = 0 for |x| 1. We can compute |r un (t, r)|2 (r)(t)rdrdt =- - =- - - = (un (t, r) - l)rr un (t, r)(r)(t)rdrdt (un (t, r) - l)r un (t, r)(r (r) + (r))(t)drdt (un (t, r) - l)tt un (t, r)(r)(t)rdrdt (un (t, r) - l)f (un (t, r)) (r)(t)rdrdt r2 (un (t, r) - l)r un (t, r) (r)(t)rdrdt

|t un (t, r)|2 (r)(|t|)rdrdt - + -

(un (t, r) - l)t un (t, r)(r) (t)rdrdt (un (t, r) - l)r un (t, r) (r)(t)rdrdt

Now from estimate (3.19), |t un (t, r)|2 (r)(t)rdrdt = o(1). Combining (3.19) with the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we also have (un (t, r) - l)t un (t, r)(r) (t)rdrdt = o(1). Also, as	has support on [1/2, 1], estimate (3.20) and the Cauchy Schwarz inequality, we have (un (t, r) - l)r un (t, r) (r)(t)rdrdt = o(1). We now use that f (l) = g (l)2 > 0. Then it follows from (3.18) that (un (t, r) - l)f (un (t, r)) (r)(t)rdrdt r2 f (l ) 2 Hence 0 - |r un (t, r)|2 (r)(t)rdrdt

|un (t, r) - l|2 (r)(t)rdrdt. r2

|un (t, r) - l|2 f (l) (r)(t)rdrdt + o(1). 2 r2 From this we deduce first that |un (t, r) - l|2 (r)(t)rdrdt  0, r2 then |r un (t, r)|2 (r)(t)rdrdt  0.
24

Adding up the last 2 results along with (3.19), we get
1 /2

un (t) - (l, 0)
-1/2

 0.

Now recalling (3.20), we get
1/2

B > 0,
-1/2

un (t) - (l, 0)
1/2

2 H L2 (r B ) dt

This shows that B > 0,
-1/2

E (un (t); 0, B )dt  0.

However, this contradicts the second estimate in (3.17), and from there, estimate (3.15) holds true. From (3.15) it is now easy to prove (3.14). Let A > 0. For n large enough, n By finite speed of propagation, we deduce that sup
t[-AJ,n ,AJ,n ]

2A.

E ((n) (t); 0, AJ,n )  0.

By coercivity of the energy around l = (n) (0), we deduce sup
t[-AJ,n ,AJ,n ]

(n) (t) - (l, 0)

H L2 ([0,AJ,n ])

 0.

Notice that for all 1

j < J , as j,n

j,n , we have
H L2 ([0,AJ,n ])

(Qj (/j,n ) - Qj (0), 0)

 0.

The last two statements and (3.13) yield (3.14). In the case J = 0, the same proof shows that sup
t[-1/2,1/2]

bn (t)

H L2 ([0,1/2])

 0.

Now (4') reads: for all r  (0, R), sup
t[-1,1]

bn (t)

H L2 ([r,R])

 0.

We add up these last two statement to conclude the case J = 0. 4. Scattering for wave maps below the L threshold Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let  be a finite energy wave map, with  () = and such that it satisfies (1.5). Notice that  (0) = and there exists c > 0 (depending only on 0 and ) such that (4.1) t  [0, T + ( )), r 0, c| (t, r) - | |g ( (t, r)| 1 | (t, r) - |. c

From this point wise bound, we derive that (4.2) t  [0, T + ( )),

CE ( ).

Also notice that T ( ) = +. Assume indeed for the sake of contradiction that T + ( ) < . Due to [25], a bubble would form: hence for a sequence of time tn  T + ( ), and of points rn ,  (tn , rn )  k where k is such that , k are two consecutive elements of V . Thus lim inf n  (tn ) -  () L |k - | d > c, a contradiction. We now do an induction on the energy in the spirit of the Kenig Merle concentration compactness argument [15, 16]. Define Ec to be the supremum of all E 0 such
25

that all wave maps  of energy E ( ) E , which satisfies  () = and (1.5), are global and scatters. Then [5, Theorem 2] shows that Ec > 0 (recall |g ( )|  {1, 2}). We now argue by contradiction and assume that Ec is finite. Step 1. We first construct a critical element, that is a wave map V defined on [0, +), that satisfies (1.5), but V - S ([0,+)) = +. Let n be a minimizing sequence of wave maps, i.e. n satisfies (1.5) (hence T + (n ) = +)), and 1 , and n - S n Up to rescaling, we can also assume that for all n E (n ) Ec +
([0,+))

= +.

E (n (0); 1, +) = Ec /100. Choose a sequence of time tn with vanishing L2 norm of t n (tn ). More precisely, we claim that for all n, there exist a sequence of times tn,m such that (1)
0<s

Now choose tn = tn,n . Then Theorem 3.3 applies to the sequence of wave maps n (t, r) = n (tn + tn t, tn r), with R = 1/2: indeed, we have by scaling sup
0<

1 1

 - 0

1 /2

|t n (t, r)|2 rdrdt  0,

and for t  [-1, 1], and r > 0, we have due to our second condition E (n (t); r, 1/2) = E (n (tn ); rtn , tn /2)  0. Also notice that due to finite speed of propagation, we have (4.3) c > 1, n (tn ) - ( , 0)
H L2 (r ctn )

 0.

We can therefore apply Theorem 3.3. It yields a bubble decomposition which is trivial: it can not contain any harmonic map profile Qj due to (1.5), and we see that for all A > 0 and sequence 0 < n tn , (4.4) n (tn ) - ( , 0)
H L2 ([n /A,An ])

and

n (tn ) -

L (0,tn /2)

 0.

Condition (2) then translate into absence of profile on scale 1: (4.5) n (tn ) - ( , 0)
H L2 ([tn /n,(1-1/n)tn ])

 0.

Using the third condition, we also get (4.6) n (tn ) -
L

 0.

In view of (4.2) n (tn ) - ( , 0) is bounded in H  L2 , hence admits (up to a subsequence) a profile decomposition in the sense of Theorem 2.12. Denote Vj,L the linear profiles, and (tj,n , j,n ) the parameters.
26

We claim that there are no nontrivial profiles Vj such that tj,n = 0. Consider indeed such a profile Vj , for the sake of contradiction. Up to extracting, and changing scale by a fixed factor, it suffices to rule out three cases: 1) j,n tn , 2) j,n = tn , 3) j,n tn .  0. In case 1), from (4.4), for any A > 1, we have n (tn ) - ( , 0)
H L2 (tj,n /A r Aj,n )

Recall the Pythagorean expansion with cut-off Proposition 2.13, it implies in particular that r 1 r Vj,L 0,  0. , t Vj,L 0, j,n j,n j,n H L2 (j,n /A r Aj,n ) Unscaling, we get Vj,L (0)
H L2 ([1/A,A])

 0.

As this is true for all A > 1, we get Vj,L (0) = 0. In case 3), from (4.3) and Proposition 2.13, we similarly get with c = 2 Vj,L 0, Unscaling, we deduce Vj,L (0)
H L2 (r 2tn /j,n )

r j,n

,

1 r t Vj,L 0, j,n j,n

 0.
H L2 (r 2tn )

 0.

As tn /j,n  0, we get Vj,L (0) = 0. In case 2), from (4.5) and Proposition 2.13, we get Vj,L 0, r tn , 1 j,n t Vj,L 0, r tn  0,
H L2 (tn /n r tn (1-1/n))

which after unsealing yields Vj,L (0)
H L2 ([1/n,1-1/n])

 0.

Similarly, (4.3) and Proposition 2.13 give after unscaling Vj,L (0)
H L2 ([c,+))

 0.

Hence Vj,L (0) = 0. We ruled out all three cases, and this establish our claim that there is no profile with tj,n = 0. tj,n Consider now the set J of indices j such that  + and the nonlinear j,n profile Vj does not scatter at + (or blows up in finite time). Any of these profile have energy greater or equal to Ec > 0, hence (by Pythagorean expansion of the energy) there only is a finite number of them. If there is no such profiles then for all j , Vj S (t -tj,n /j,n ) is bounded (it tends to 0 if tj,n /j,n	-). Then Proposition 2.15 shows that there is a uniform bound M such that, for all sequence n tn , n -
S ([tn ,n ])

M.

This in turn implies that n scatters at +: it is a contradiction. Hence J = . We can assume without loss of generality that J is indexed by 1, . . . , J0 . Among such j J0 , choose j,n slowest, then among such j , we consider j0 such that tj0 ,n is lowest, i.e j J0 , j,n  + or j0 ,n j,n = j0 ,n and

tj0 ,n - tj,n  - . j0 ,n

V := Vj0 will be our critical element. First let us show that V is global and satisfies (1.5). Let t  [0, T + (V )) and r 0. Define n = tj0 ,n + j0 ,n t. Then Vj0 ,L

+ J,n (n , j0 ,n r) + rJ,n (n , j0 ,n r). By inspection (arguing as in the proof of equation (2.5)), we deduce that |V (t, r) - | c. It follows that Vj satisfies (1.5); as noticed above, we then have T + (V ) = +. Also, due to the Pythagorean expansion of the energy, we see that E (V ) Ec .

As we chose it so that it does not scatter at +, we must have E (V ) = Ec by definition of the critical energy: therefore V is a critical element. Step 2. We reach a contradiction. For this, we can repeat the argument of Step 1 on V : there exist a sequence of times tn  + such that 1 tn +s tn /4 (1) sup |t V (t, r)|2 rdrdt  0 as n  +, s 0<s tn /2 tn -s 0 (2) V (tn ) - L  0, (3) V (tn ) - ( , 0) admits a profile decomposition, with profiles Uj,L . Also, as the bubble decomposition yield no bubble, convergence up to the last scale shows that (4.7) V (tn ) - ( , 0)
H L2 ([0,tn /2])

 0.

Arguing as in Step 1, we see that one of the nonlinear profiles Uj0 is critical, in particular E (Uj0 ) = Ec = E (V ). By Pythagorean expansion of the energy, it follows that there are no other nontrivial linear profiles in the profile decomposition of V (tn ), and that the dispersion term tends to 0 in H  L2 . In short, there holds V (tn , r) - ( , 0) = Uj0 ,L - r tj0 ,n , j0 ,n j0 ,n , 1 tj ,n r t Uj0 ,L - 0 , j0 ,n j0 ,n j0 ,n + on (1),

where the on (1) is in H  L2 . Assume tj0 ,n = 0. Observe that V has energy on the light cone: from monotonicity of the energy along light cones, Proposition 2.1 and (4.7), we have lim sup V (tn ) - ( , 0)
n+ H L2 (|r -tn | A) 28

In particular, V (tn ) - ( , 0) r j0 ,n
H L2 (|r -tn | tn /2)

Now, as Uj0 ,L (0) = 0, let  > 0 such that Uj0 ,L (0) Uj0 ,L 0, , 1 r t Uj0 ,L 0, j0 ,n j0 ,n

H L2 ([j0 ,n ,2j0 ,n ])

Comparing with V (tn ) we must have for n large enough 2j0 ,n tn /2 and j0 ,n 3tn /2. Up to extracting, we can furthermore assume that j0 ,n /tn    (0, +). But then, unscaling the concentration on V (tn ) we have lim sup Uj0 ,L (0)
n+ H L2 (|r -tn |/j0 ,n A/j0 ,n )

 0 as A  +.

But this implies Uj0 ,L (0) = 0, a contradiction. tj,n Assume now that	+. Then Uj0 ,L S ((-;-tj,n /j,n ])  0 so the same j,n holds for the non linear profile: Uj0 S ((-;-tj,n /j,n ])  0. Then applying Proposition 2.15 backward in time up to time t = 0 tn , we get V -
S (0,tn )

Uj0 -

Hence by monotone convergence, we deduce U S ([0,+)) = 0, and V = 0, a contradiction. tj,n  -. Then Uj0 ,L S ([-tj,n /j,n ,+))	0 so the same Assume finally that j,n holds for the non linear profile: Uj0 - S ([-tj,n /j,n ,+))  0. Then we can use Proposition 2.15 to get that for any sequence n tn , V -
S ([tn ,n ))

This implies V - S ([tn ,+))  0: in particular V scatters at +, a contradiction. We reached a contradiction in all cases, hence Ec = +. 5. Outside the light cone Proposition 5.1 (Scattering state).

Proof. First we recall Proposition 2.1, hence it suffices to construct L such that for all A 0, (5.1)  (t) - ( , 0) - L (t)
H L2 (r t-A)

 0 as t  +.

The proof follows the scheme of [7, Proposition 2.8], except now it is more involved to obtain scattering for the approximations of  around the light cone. We crucially rely on our new scattering result Theorem 1.2. Let tn	+ and define the sequence of wave maps n with data at time tn as a suitable extension in H  L2 of  (tn )|r tn /2 , as in Lemma A.3. Specifically let n (tn ) = (n,0 , n,1 ) where  2  (tn , tn /2) - r + if r tn /2, n,0 (r) = tn   (tn , r) if r tn /2,
29

n,1 (r) = t  (tn , r). (Recall that (5.2) =  ()). Then n (0) = n () = n (tn ) - ( , 0) and from Lemma A.3,  0.

H L2 (r tn /2)

By construction  and n coincide at time tn on [tn /2, +), hence by finite speed of propagation, as long as they are defined at time t, (5.3) r tn /2 + |t - tn |, n (t, r) =  (t, r).

Step 1: Let us show that for n large enough, (1) n is defined on [A0 , +) for some A0 not depending on n. (2) n scatters at +. Choose  = 1/2 in Proposition 2.1, and apply it to  : lim sup E ( (t); t/2, t - A)  0 as A  +.
t+

We then deduce that lim sup E (n (tn ); 0, tn - A)  0 as A  +.

Let E > 0 be the minimal energy of a non constant harmonic map Q with Q() = (or if   V \ { } are the closest elements to , with - < < + , E = 2 min{G( + ) - G( ), G( ) - G( - )}. Choose A0 large enough, so that for n large enough, E ( (tn ); 0, tn - A0 ) E /2, By finite speed of propagation, we deduce that for all  such that n (t +  ) is defined E (n (tn +	); 0, tn - A0 - | |) E (n (tn ); 0, tn - A0 ) E /2. We recall the blowup criterion derived in [25]: blow up concentrates in the light cone an energy at least E . Hence for | | tn - A0 , this blow up criterion shows that n (tn +  ) is well defined: it then suffices to choose  = A0 - tn , and T - (n ) < A0 . Of course we can drop the first terms, so that is holds for all n. We now turn to scattering at +. For this, we will prove that as n  +, (5.4) sup

By monotonicity of the energy outside cones, we see that for all A  R, the limit limt+ E ( (t), t - A, +) exists, let us denote it E (A). As the energy density is non-negative, E (A) is an increasing function of A, and is also bounded by E ( ). Denote E = limA+ E (A) E ( ). Let us show that (5.5) E - E (A) E ( (t); t/2, +)  E . E and lim sup E ( (t); t/2, t - A)

Indeed, let  > 0, and choose A large so that

2.

Then for all t

E ( (t); t-A, +)

(5.5) follows. Now, from (5.5) and 2.1, we have (5.6) lim sup |E ( (t); t - A, +) - E |  0 as A  +.
t+

From (5.5) and (5.2), we deduce that (5.7) E (n (tn ))	E t as n  +.

We now prove (5.4). Let  > 0. From (5.6), there exist A1 and T1 such that T1 , t Define now N such that tN |E ( (t); t - A1 , +) - E | T2 ,  (t) - . N, .

We also use Corollary 2.4. Let T2 such that
L (r t/2)

max{T1 , 2A1 , T2 } and for n |E (n (tn )) - E | .

Then for n N , we have tn tN so that if t tn /2 + |t - tn |. By (5.3), it transpires t	[tn , T + (n )), By conservation of the energy, t  [tn , T + (n )), t  [tn , T + (n )), Also if t tn , then t r This proves that for n t - A1 , N, n (t) -

Due to the point wise bound, we get as n (0) =

which is exactly (5.4). Then Theorem 1.2 applies for all n N , and shows that T + (n ) = + and n scatters at +. Also notice that (5.4) and (5.7) show that for some C > 0 and for n large enough, (5.8) sup n (t) - ( , 0)

Step 2: Construction of L and end of proof. Let n,L be the linear solution of (LW ) which is the scattering state of n , that is, for all n, (5.9) n (t) - ( , 0) - n,L (t)
H L2

 0 as t  +.

Recall that the flow of (LW ) preserves the H  L2 norm. Along with the bound on n (t) H L2 , this shows that n,L (0)
H L 2

CE .

Up to extracting, we can assume that n,L (0) has a weak limit L (0) in H  L2 . We define L (t) as the linear solution of (LW ) with initial data L (0) at time 0. Let n be such that 1 n (n ) - ( , 0) - n,L (n ) H L2 . n
31

Up to extracting further, we can assume that the sequence n (n ) - ( , 0) - L (n ), which is bounded in H  L2 , admits a profile decomposition in the sense of Theorem 2.12: n (n , r) - ( , 0) = L (n , r)

Notice that this appears as a profile decomposition for the sequence (n,L (n , r)) with first profile L and parameter t1,n = n , 1,n = 1. Indeed, the profile decomposition is constructed of via taking weak limits, that is: Vj,L (0) is the weak limit of [j,n ]S (tj,n )(n (n ) - ( , 0)), where S (t) is the linear flow of (LW ) and  is the scaling operator [](0 , 1 )(t, r) := 0 t r ,   , 1 1  t r ,	 .

Also L (0) is the weak limit of S (-n )([1]n (n ) - ( , 0)) = S (-n )(n (n ) - ( , 0)). Indeed endow H	L2 with the natural scalar product derived from the H  L2 norm: 0 0 ,  = 1 1 + r 0 r 0 + g ( )2 2 rdr r Then S (t) is an isometry for , and if	 H  L2 , S (-n )(n (n ) - ( , 0)),  = n (n ) - ( , 0), S (-n ) = n,L (n ), S (-n ) + O(1/n) = n,L (0),	+ O(1/n)  L (0),  . We now proceed to prove (5.1); it suffices to show A 0,  (t) - ( , 0) - L (t)

Let A 0 and N be such that for tN 2A. Notice that in a similar fashion as previously, there hold the following profile decomposition for the sequence (n (n ) - ( , 0) - N,L (n ) n (n , r) - ( , 0) - N,L (n , r) = L (n , r) - N,L (n , r)

Now recall (5.9) and (5.3), so that (5.10)
H L2 (r t-tN /2)

 0 as t  +. t - tN /2, we get  0 as t  +.

As n and  coincide for r

t - tn /2, hence for r
H L2 (r t-tN /2)

Using the Pythagorean expansion with cut off (Proposition 2.13), we deduce that for all profiles in the above profile decomposition, the H  L2 (r t - tn /2) (semi-) norm tends to 0, and more specifically for the first profile, we get L (n ) - N,L (n )
H L2 (r n -tN /2)

 0 as n  +.

As L (t) - N,L (t) is solution to the linear solution (LW ), using monotonicity of the H  L2 norm on outside cones, we deduce L (t) - N,L (t)
H L2 (r t-tN /2) 32

 0 as t  +.

Combined with (5.10), we get  (t) - ( , 0) - L (t) As tN /2
H L2 (r t-tN /2)

 0 as t  +.

A, this proves (5.1), and the proof is complete.

We now turn to the analogous result regarding blow up wave maps. Proposition 5.2. We assume (A1)-(A2). Let  be a finite energy wave map that blows up at time T + ( ). Then there exist := limtT + ()  (t, T + ( ) - t)  V and a wave map  defined on a neighborhood of T + ( ) such that for t < T + ( ) and t r and (t) - ( , 0)
H L2 ([0,T + ( )-t])

max{0, T - ()}	(t, r) = (t, r), 0 as t  T + ( ).

T + ( ) - t,

Proof. Step 1. Let us first construct . Claim 5.3.  (t, T + ( ) - t) has a limit  V as t  T + ( ).

Proof. Indeed, we recall Proposition 2.1 with  = 1/2: E ( (t); (T + ( ) - t)/2, T + ( ) - t)  0 as t  T + ( ). In particular, we get sup
r [(T + ( )-t)/2,T + ( )-t]

|G( (t, r)) - G( (t, T + ( ) - t))|  0.

Also recall that for all t,  (t) L K . As G is a homeomorphism R  R from Assumption (A1)-(A2), we get that G-1 is uniformly continuous on [G(-K ), G(K )] and from there, sup
r [(T + ( )-t)/2,T + ( )-t]

| (t, r) -  (t, T + ( ) - t)|  0.

Now we use again the vanishing of the energy in the self-similar region:
T + ( )-t

|g ( (t, r)|2
(T + ( )-t)/2

dr  0, r

so that there exist r(t)  [(T + ( ) - t)/2, T + ( ) - t] such that g ( (t, r(t))  0 as t  T + ( ). By the previous uniform convergence and continuity of g , we derive g ( (t, T + ( ) - t))  0. Now t	 (t, T + ( ) - t) is continuous on [0, T + ( )). As V = g -1 ({0}) is discrete, this implies that  (t, T + ( ) - t) has limit  V as t  T + ( ), as desired. Now consider any sequence of time n  T + ( ) and the wave maps n defined at time n as follows  +   +  (n , T ( ) - n ) - r if 0 r T + ( ) -  n n (n , r) = T + ( ) - n   ( , r) if r T + ( ) - n n t n (n , r) = 0 if 0 t  (n , r) if r r T + ( ) - n T + ( ) - n . n (m , r) = m (m , r),

Let m > n. By definition and finite speed of propagation, we have r T + ( ) - n - |n - m |,
33

hence, using again finite speed of propagation, r 2T + ( ) - 2n , n (T + ( ), r) = m (T + ( ), r),

It is then meaningful to define  to be the wave map with initial data at time T + ( ): (5.11) (T + ( ), r) = n (T + ( ), r) for r 2T + ( ) - 2n .

Step 2. Properties of . Let E (t) := E ( (t); T + ( ) - t, ). This is a non-decreasing function, so let us define here E := lim E (t).
tT + ( )

Of course E there holds

E ( ). Then by construction of n and as n (n , T + ( ) - n )  ,

E ( n )  E . Hence by monotone convergence, we deduce that E () = lim E ((T + ( )); T + ( ) - 2n , +)
n

lim E (n (T + ( ) - n ); T + ( ) - n , +) = E ,
n

that is E ()

E . On the other side, lim E (n (T + ( ) - n ); T + ( ) - n , +) = E ,
n

E () = E ((T + ( )); 0, +)

and finally we obtain that  has finite energy (5.12) E () = E . By definition of  (5.11) and finite speed of propagation, for all t  (T - (), T + ( )) we have: r 3T + ( ) - t - 2n , (t, r) = n (t, r), which yields for t = n r 3T + ( ) - 3n , (n , r) = n (n , r) =  (n , r), Hence, again by finite speed of propagation, we conclude that for t  (T - (), n ] r 3T + ( ) - t - 2n , r > T + ( ) - t,
+

(t, r) =  (t, r),

Letting n  +, we finally obtain that for t  (T - (), T + ( )): (5.13) (t, r) =	(t, r).

By continuity, for t < T ( ), it also holds for r = T + ( ) - t. In particular, (t, T + ( ) - t)  Now by definition of E , (5.13) implies that E ((t, r); T + ( ) - t, +)  E = E (), and by difference E ((t, r); 0, T + ( ) - t)  0. As (t, T + ( ) - t)  , this implies sup
r [0,T + ( )-t] 34

as t  T + ( ).

|(t, r) - |  0 as t  T + ( ).

Therefore (0) =

6. H  L2 convergence for the bubble decomposition In this Section we consider again a sequence of wave maps, and improve the result of Theorem 3.3 under the extra assumption (A3), that is  V, g ( )  {-1, 1}. We show that that the error term in the bubble decomposition does in fact convergence to 0 in H  L2 . This is the only step in this paper where we use (A3): it guaranties that Proposition (2.10) holds for the linearized problem (LW ). This Section is independent of Section 4 and 5. Proposition 6.1. We assume (A1)-(A2)-(A3). Let n be a sequence of wave maps as in Theorem 3.3, and we use its notations. We recall the existence of harmonic maps Q1 , . . . QJ and scales J,n    1,n 1 and denote
J

bn (t, r) := n (t, r) - ( , 0) -
j =1

(Qj (r/j,n ), 0).

Then bn (0)
H L2 ([0,R])

asn  +.

Proof. By Theorem 3.3, we recall that bn has vanishing energy at all scale, but we only use this property for the scales 0,n , . . . J,n here. More precisely, we will use the following convergence: there exists an increasing sequence n  + (and we also denote 0,n = 1), such that (1) bn (t) L ([-n J,n ,n J,n ],H L2 (r n J,n ))	0, (2) bn (t) L ([-n j,n ,n j,n ],H L2 (j,n /n r n j,n ))  0 for all j = 1, . . . , J - 1, (3) bn (t) L ([-A,A],H L2 (r 0,n /n ))  0, (4) t bn (0) L2 (r R)  0. (5) bn (0) L (r R)  0. (6) supt[-A,A] bn (t) H L2 (r R) is bounded. In particular, (6.1) bn (0)

and

We now argue by contradiction. Assume that bn (0) H L2 ([0,R])	0 as n	+. Up to extracting, we can assume that for some 0 > 0, (6.2) n, bn (0)
H ([0,R])

0 .

Due to convergences (1)-(2)-(3), and up to extracting further, there exists j  1, . . . , J and 1 > 0 such that (6.3) bn (0) H L2 ([0,n j,n ])	0, and n  N, bn (0) H ([  , j-1,n ]) 1 .

Let n  + such that n = o(n ), as n  +. We consider two times:

n = o(k-1,n /k,n ),

We denote m = Qj (): the linearized flow which will interest is now given by (LWm ). Let bn,L be the linear solution to (LWm ) with initial data at time 0:  bn (0, r) if r 42,n    b (0, 4 ) n 2,n (52,n - r) if 42,n r 52,n bn,L (0, r) =  2,n   0 if r 52,n , t bn,L (0) = 0. Claim 6.2. We have (6.4) n (1,n ) - (m, 0) - bn,L (1,n )
H L2 ([1,n ,32,n ])

 0 as n  +.

Proof. By definition of bn and (2), notice that n (1,n ) - (m, 0) - bn (1,n )
H L2 ([1,n ,32,n ])

 0.

Hence we are led to compare bn and bn,L . First consider the interval [1,n , 21,n ]. Due to finite speed of propagation, we have bn,L (1,n )
H L2 ([1,n ,21,n ])

bn,L (0)

H L2 ([0,31,n ])

by (6.3). Using (2), we conclude bn (1,n ) - (m, 0) - bn,L (1,n ) bn (1,n )
H L2 ([1,n ,21,n ])

H L2 ([1,n ,21,n ])

+ bn,L (1,n )

H L2 ([1,n ,21,n ])

We now work on [21,n , 32,n ]. Consider the wave maps n with initial data defined as follows  n (0, 1,n ) - m  m+ r if 0 r 1,n	  1,n	 (0, r) if 1,n r 42,n n n (0, r) =  (0 , 4  ) - m  n 2 ,n  m+ (52,n - r) if 42,n r 52,n    2,n	 m if r 52,n t n (0, r) = t n (0, r) if 1,n r 0 otherwise. 42,n

n (0) is an extension of n (0) with adequate affine reconnection. n coincide with n on [1,n , 42,n ] at time 0, and hence at time 1,n 2,n we have (6.5) r  [21,n , 32,n ], n (1,n , r) = n (1,n , r).  0.

Also n (0) = n () = m and n - m
L

Because n (0, 1,n ) and n (0, 42,n ) tend to m, and with the equivalence of energy and H  L2 norm for L -small perturbation of m  V (Lemma A.1), we infer that n (0) is bounded in H  L2 . And finally, we clearly have t n (0)

Hence Corollary 2.14 combined with Corollary 2.16 allows to conclude that n is globally defined on R and (6.6) sup n (t) - (m, 0) - n,L (t)

where n,L is the linear solution to (LWm ) with initial data n,L (0) = n (0) - (m, 0) at time 0. Now notice that n,L - bn,L is a solution to (LWm ) which also satisfies n,L (0) - bn,L (0)

By conservation of the Hm  L norm, we deduce that (6.7) n,L (1,n ) - bn,L (1,n ) n (1,n ) - (m, 0) - bn,L (1,n ) This proves the claim. We now evolve up to time 2,n . Claim 6.3. We have n (2,n ) - (m, 0) - bn,L (2,n ) Proof. Let

Combining (6.5), (6.6) and (6.7) yields

32,n

Notice that E ( n (1,n ); 0, 31,n )  0 (consider separately the intervals [0, 1,n ] and [1,n , 31,n ]), hence bn,N L is defined at least on the time interval (-21,n , 41,n ), and by monotonicity of the energy along cones (6.8) E(
n (0); 0, 21,n )

 0.

Similarly, E ( n (1,n ); 32,n -21,n , +)  0 because 32,n -21,n 22,n (consider separately the intervals [32,n - 21,n , 32,n ], [32,n , 42,n ], and [42,n , )). Hence, again by monotonicity of the energy along light cones, (6.9) Let us show that (6.10)

Indeed, by finite speed of propagation, r  [21,n , 32,n - 1,n ], n (0) - (m, 0)
n (0, r )

= n (0, r).  0.

Hence the convergence on this interval follows from (6.1) which implies
H L2 ([21,n ,32,n ])

Therefore, (6.10) follows from this combined with (6.8), (6.9) (recall the equivalence of the energy and the H	L2 norm under the assumption of small energy, Lemma A.1). Due to (6.10), we conclude from Corollary 2.14 combined with Corollary 2.16 that n is global and if we denote n,L the linear solution to (LWm ) with initial data n (0) - (m, 0) at time 0 : (6.11)

Notice that at time 1,n , we have bn,L (1,n ) - +  0. Now bn,L - n,L is a solution to (LWm ): due to monotonicity of the Hm  L2 along cones, and as [2,n , 22,n ]  [2,n , 32,n - (2,n - 1,n )], we deduce bn,L (2,n ) - Hence, we get from (6.11)
n (2,n ) n,L (2,n ) H L2 ([2,n ,22,n ]) n,L (1,n ) H L2 (([1,n ,32,n ]) H L2 ([1,n ,32,n ]) H L2 (([1,n ,32,n ])

To complete the proof, it suffices to notice that n and n coincide at time 1,n on the interval [1,n , 32,n ], so that at time 2,n , they coincide on the interval [2,n , 22,n ]. We can now easily reach a contradiction. Indeed from (2)-(3)-(4), equivalence of energy and H	L2 for L perturbation (Lemma A.1) and the definition of n , we have  (2,n ) - (m, 0)

From the definition of bn,L (0), we see that bn,L (0)

 (1)1 > 0.

Then (6.12) and (6.13) are in contradiction with Claim 6.3. This shows that bn (0) H ([0,R])  0, and so bn (0) H L2 ([0,R])  0, as desired.

Consider now the sequence of wave maps n (t, r) = ( (tn + tn t, tn r), tn t  (tn + tn t, tn r), Then for R = 1/2 and A = 1/4, the sequence n satisfies the conditions of Theorem 3.3, which we can combine with Proposition 6.1. Hence there exists harmonic maps Q1 , . . . , QJ and scales J,n  1,n 1 such that

(Qj (/j,n ) - Qj (), 0)

Unscaling, and denoting j,n = j,n /tn , we have

Also, for all j , as j,n tn , Qj (/j,n ) - Qj () with (7.1), (7.2) and (7.3) yields

This concludes the proof in the global case. 7.2. Blow up case. Let  be a wave map which blow-up in finite time T + ( ). Proposition 5.2 show that there is a regular wave map (t) defined on a neighborhood of T + ( ) such that for t < T + ( ) (and t near enough T + ( )) there holds (7.4) r T + ( ) - t,	(t, r) = (t, r).

Also  (t, T + ( ) - t)	 V and (7.5) (t) - ( , 0)

Now Corollary 2.7 provides us with a sequence tn  T + ( ) such that (we denote n = T + ( ) - tn ) sup

|t  (t, r)|2 rdrdt  0 as n  +.

Then sequence of wave maps n (t, r) := ( (tn + n t, n r), n t  (tn + n t, n r),

satisfies the conditions of Theorem 3.3 with R = 1 (and A = 1) which we can combine with Proposition 6.1. Hence there exists harmonic maps Q1 , . . . , QJ and scales J,n  1,n 1 such that
J

n (0) - ( , 0) -
j =1

(Qj (/j,n ) - Qj (), 0)

Let us unscale, and denote j,n = j,n /n , and recall (7.5) to deduce
J

(7.6)

 (tn ) - (tn ) -

(Qj (/j,n ) - Qj (), 0)

Hence combining with (7.4), this yields

This settles the proof of Theorem 1.1 in the blow-up case. Appendix A. Proof of Lemma 3.2 Lemma A.1 (Energy and H norm). Let  V , and  be a function of finite energy on [r1 , r2 ], with 0 r1 < r2 .

 then the hypothesis and the conclusion

Proof. These bounds are elementary, based on the Taylor expansion of g and G around . We refer to [4] for the first result, and to [6] for the second and third ones. Our goal is now to prove Lemma 3.2. We start by a claim regarding the control of L norm by H even locally outside 0 or . Lemma A.2. There exists c > 0 such that for any 0 r2 2r1 , and	H ([r1 , r2 ]), then   C ([r1 , r2 ]) and
L ([r1 ,r2 ])

c

H ([r1 ,r2 ]) .

Proof. We focus on the case 0 < r1 and r2 < , as the other cases are well-known and simpler. We recall that for r s,

This proves continuity. Then let r0  [r1 , r2 ] be such that  L ([r1 ,r2 ]) = |(r0 )|. If  L ([r1 ,r2 ])  H ([r1 ,r2 ]) , there is nothing to prove. Assume the opposite, that is  L ([r1 ,r2 ])  H ([r1 ,r2 ]) .

Then if r  [r1 , r2 ] is such that |r - r0 | r0 then |(r)| Now as ln r r0  L ([r1 ,r2 ]) and 2	H ([r1 ,r2 ]) |(r0 ))| -

Proof. Again, we only consider here the case 0 < r1 < r2 < + and leave the other simpler cases to the reader. We extend  in the following way: let r1 = r1 /2 and r2 = 2r2 and	if r r0  0   r -r1   ( r ) if r1 r r1 (affine extension)  1 r1 -r1   (r) = (r) . if r1 r r2   r2 -r   (r2 ) r -r2 if r2 r r2 (affine extension)  2   0 if r2 r Then  is continuous, hence we deduce   H and

hence, if we combine it with the previous Lemma when r2

Proof of Lemma 3.2. The proof relies on [4, Corollary 2.4], which we recall for the convenience of the reader: Lemma A.4 ([4, Corollary 2.4]). Let T that if the wave map  satisfies  (0) - (Q, 0) then T ( ) > T and t  [0, T ],  (t) - (Q, 0)

Let  = /(3c + 2), where  is given by Lemma A.4 and c is as in Lemmas A.2 and A.3. If we consider the restriction of  (0) - Q to [r1 , r2 ], Lemma A.3 yields an initial data 0 such that 0 - Q	H , r  [r1 , r2 ], and 0 (0) - Q Define 1 (0, r) = t  (0, r) if r1 r r2 , 0 otherwise,

Hence by Lemma A.4,  is defined at least up to time T and if furthermore |t| (t) - (Q, 0)

Also, by finite speed of propagation for any t	(T - ( ), T + ( ) such that |t| (r2 - r1 )/2, r  [r1 + |t|, r2 - |t|], (t, r) =  (t, r). Combining the last two properties proves Lemma 3.2.
