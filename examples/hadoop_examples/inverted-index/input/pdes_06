We prove that the multidimensional dimensional initial value problem for the Navier-Stokes equations is globally well-posed in the so-called Moment and Grand Lebesgue Spaces (GLS), and give some a priory estimations for solution in this spaces. We consider separately the cases of small initial value solution (local solution) and global solution. Keywords and phrases: Multivariate Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, Riesz integral transform, rearrangement invariant, Grand and ordinary Lebesgue - Riesz spaces, initial value problem, Helmholtz-Weyl projection, divergence, Laplace operator, pseudo - differential operator, global and short-time well - posedness, lifespan of solution. 2000 AMS Subject Classification: Primary 37B30, 33K55, 35Q30, 35K45; Secondary 34A34, 65M20, 42B25.

Statement of problem. We consider in this article the initial value problem for the multivariate NavierStokes (NS) equations ut - u + (u  )u = P, x  Rd , d  3, t > 0; Div(u) = 0, x  Rd , t > 0; u(x, 0) = u0 (x), x  Rd . 1 (1.1) (1.2) (1.3)

and u == u(t) = u(t, ) = u(x, t) denotes the (vector) velocity of fluid in the point x at the time t, P is represents the pressure. Equally:

the system (1.1) - (1.3) may be rewritten as follows: ut = u + (u  )u + Q    (u  u), x	Rd , t > 0; Div(u) = 0, x  Rd , t > 0; u(x, 0) = u0 (x), x  Rd , (1.4) (1.5) (1.6)

where Q is multidimensional Helmholtz-Weyl projection operator, i.e., the d  d matrix pseudo-differential operator in Rd with the matrix symbol ai,j ( ) = i,j - i j /|| ||2, i,j = 1, i = j ; i,j = 0, i = j. We will understand henceforth as a capacity of the solution (1.4) - (1.6) the vector - function u = u = {u1 (x, t), u2 (x, t), . . . , ud (x, t)} the so-called mild solution, see [24].

Namely, the vector- function u = u(t) satisfies almost everywhere in the time t the following non-linear integral - differential equation: u(t) = et u0 +

where the operator exp(s) is the classical integral operator with heat kernel: et [u0 ](x, t) = (4t)-d/2 u0 (y ) exp - dy. (1.8)

More results about the existence, uniqueness, numerical methods, and a priory estimates in the different Banach function spaces: Lebesgue-Riesz Lp , Morrey, Besov for this solutions see, e.g. in [1]- [33]. The first and besides famous result belong to J.Leray [22]; it is established there in particular the global in time solvability and uniqueness of NS system in the space L2 (Rd ) and was obtained a very interest a priory estimate for solution. The immediate predecessor for offered article is the article of Shangbin Cui [1]; in this article was considered the case u0	L2 (Rd )  Lp (Rd ), p > d. See also celebrate works of Y.Giga [10] - [13] and T.Kato [15] - [16]. Our purpose in this report is to generalize aforementioned results about solvability of NS system on the wide class of rearrangement invariant spaces and to obtain some useful a priory estimates for this solution. This estimates allow us to establish some new properties of solution and develop numerical methods. Grand Lebesgue Spaces. We recall here briefly the definition and some simple properties of the so-called (Bilateral) Grand Lebesgue Spaces (GLS); more detail presentment see, e.g. in [37], [47], [48], [50], [51]. Let (X, , ) be a measure space; in the considered problem X = Rd with Lebesgue measure d = dx. For a and b constants, 1  a < b  , let	=  (p), p  (a, b), be a continuous log-convex positive function such that  (a + 0) and	(b - 0) exist, with max{ (a + 0),  (b - 0)} =  and min{ (a + 0),  (b - 0)} > 0. The (Bilateral) Grand Lebesgue Space (in notation GLS = BGLS) GX (;  ; a, b) = GX ( ; a, b) = G( ; a, b) = G( ) is the space of all measurable functions h : X	R endowed with the norm ||h||G( ) = sup ||h||p/ (p),

The G( ) spaces with (X ) = 1 appeared in [47]; it was proved that in this case each G( ) space coincides with certain exponential Orlicz space, up to norm equivalence. Partial cases of these spaces were intensively studied, in particular, their associate spaces, fundamental functions (G( ; a, b);  ), Fourier and singular operators, conditions for convergence and compactness, reflexivity and separability, 3

martingales in these spaces, etc.; see, e.g. in [37], [38], [39], [47], [40], [41], [43], [48], [50], [51] etc. These spaces are also Banach and moreover rearrangement invariant (r.i.). The BGLS norm estimates, in particular, Orlicz norm estimates for measurable functions, e.g., for random variables are used in the theory of PDE, probability in Banach spaces, in the modern non-parametrical statistics, for example, in the so-called regression problem. We note that the G( ) spaces are also interpolation spaces (the so-called spaces). However, we hope that our direct representation of these spaces is of certain convenience in both theory and applications. A natural question arises what happens if the spaces other than Lp are used in the definition. Indeed, this is possible and might be of interest, but, for example, using Lorenz spaces in this capacity leads to the same object. Remark 1.1. If we define the degenerate r (p), r = const 1 function as follows: r (p) = , p = r ; r (r ) = 1, (1.10)

and agree C/ = 0, C = const > 0, then the Gr () space coincides with the classical Lebesgue space Lr . Thus, the Grand Lebesgue Spaces are direct generalization of the classical Lebesgue - Riesz spaces. Remark 1.2. We will denote in the case X = Rd by G0 X (;  ; a, b) = = G0 ( ; a, b) = G0 ( ) the subspace of the space GX (;	; a, b) = GX ( ; a, b) = G( ; a, b) = G( ) which consists on all the functions {h = h(x)}, x  Rd from this set such that G0 X ( ; a, b) Div h = 0. (1.11)

Analogously, the space L0 p consists on all the functions from the space Lp with zero divergence. In what follows we will suppose Div u0 = 0; therefore, Div u( x, t) = 0 for all the values t for which the solution u(x, t) there exists. Remark 1.3. Multidimensional case. Let u = u = {u1 (x), u2 (x), . . . , ud (x)} be measurable vector - function. We can define as ordinary the G norm of the function u by the following way: ||u||G := max ||uk ||G.
k =1,2,...,d

Remark 1.4. Natural choice. Let v = v (x) = 0, x  X be some (measurable) function for which there exist two constants a, b : 1	a < b	such that p  (a, b)  ||v ||p < . The  = (v) (p) function of a view

4

is said to be natural function for the function v ().

(v) (p) = ||v ||p, p  (a, b)

Analogously, for the family of a functions v = v (x, ),   A, A is an arbitrary set, the natural function  = (v) (p) may be defined as follows: (v) (p) = sup ||v (, )||p, p  (a, b),
A

if there exists. Obviously, sup ||v (, )||G(v) = 1.

This approach is very convenient, e.g., in the theory of Probability and Statistics. Moment Rearrangement Invariant Spaces. Let (X = Rd , ||  ||X ) be any r.i. space, where X is linear subset on the space of all measurable function Rd  R over our measurable space (T, M, ) with norm ||  ||X. Recall the following definition, see, e.g. [53], [54], where are described some applications of these spaces in the Approximation Theory and in the Theory of Partial Differential Equations. We will say that the space X with the norm ||  ||X is moment rearrangement invariant space, briefly: m.r.i. space, or X = (X, ||  ||X )  m.r.i., if there exist a real constants a, b; 1  a < b  , and some rearrangement invariant norm <  > defined on the space of a real functions defined on the interval (a, b), non necessary to be finite on all the functions, such that f  X  ||f ||X =< h() >, h(p) = |f |p . (1.12)

We will say that the space X with the norm ||||X is weak moment rearrangement space, briefly, w.m.r.i. space, or X = (X, ||||X )  w.m.r.i., if there exist a constants a, b; 1	a < b  , and some functional F, defined on the space of a real functions defined on the interval (a, b), non necessary to be finite on all the functions, such that f  X  ||f ||X = F ( h() ), h(p) = |f |p . (a, b) = supp(X ), (moment support; not necessary to be uniquely defined) and define for other such a space Y = (Y, ||  ||Y ) with (c, d) = supp(Y ) supp(X ) >> supp(Y ), iff min(a, b) > max(c, d). It is obvious that arbitrary m.r.i. space is r.i. space. 5

We will write for considered w.m.r.i. and m.r.i. spaces (X, ||	||X )

The so-called mixed, or equally anisotropic (p1 , p2 ) norm ||u|| p1 ,p2 for the function d 1 of "two" variables u = u(x, t), x  R , t	R+ is defined as follows: ||u|| p1 ,p2 =

The correspondent mixed, or anisotropic Grand Lebesgue (Lebesgue - Riesz) spaces was introduced in [56]. For the positive function of two variables  = (p, r ) defined on the set D the norm of a function in this space is defined by formula ||u||G = sup ||u|| p,r . (p, r ) (2.3)

(d) The following functional u	p (u) = p (u) in the case d = 3 was introduced and used by Shangbin Cui in [1]:
d(p-2) d(p-2) (d) p (u) = p (u) := ||u||p ||u||2 . p(d-2) 2(p-d)

(2.4)

This functional is scaling-dilation invariant. Indeed, denote T [u](x) =  u(x),   R,  = 0, then
(d) (d) p (T [u]) = p (u ).

The function KS (d, p) is the optimal (i.e. minimal) value in the famous Sobolev's inequality ||||r  KS (d, q ) ||||q , 1  q < d, see Bliss [35], (1930); Talenti, [44], (1995). 1 1 1 = - , r	1, r q d (2.6)

Since the number d is integer, the expression for KS (d, 2d/3) may be calculated in explicit view. For instance,   (d) = (d - 1)!, (d - 1/2) = d-1 (2d - 3)!!. 2 So, if the dimension d is even number, then KS (d, 2d/3) = 21/d   -

Solution for small initial data

We suppose in this section that the initial function u0 = u0 (x) belong to some Grand Lebesgue Space G such that Div u0 = 0 and d  supp . But we do not assume here that 2  supp; this case will be considered further. It is known in the case when u0  Lr , r  d and when the initial norm ||u0||r is sufficiently small, then the NS equation has a unique global (smooth) solution; see for example [1], [15] - [16]. We generalize these results on the Grand Lebesgue spaces, calculating passing the constants values. Let us denote J = p : ||u0||d < and introduce the following  - function: ~(p) =  (p), p  supp   J ;  ~(p) = 0  otherwise. ~ = . Then the Theorem 3.1. Suppose Div u0 = 0, d  supp  and supp  global in time solution of NS system u(t) there exists with monotonically decreased ~ and moreover norm ||u(t)||G0 ~ = ||u0||G. sup ||u(t)||G0

then there exists and is unique the global in time solution of NS system u(t), t > 0 such that the function t  ||u(t)||d is monotonically decreasing. 2.

Global solution.

It is proved in [1] that if (4.1) for some b  d, then the Navier - Stokes equations, more precisely, the system of Navier - Stokes equations (1.1) - (1.3) has unique global in time smooth solution u = u(x) = u(x, t). But if the condition (4.1) is satisfied, we still have to take admit that the function u0 () belongs to some Grand Lebesgue space. In detail, there exists a function	= b (p) with support [2, b) such that t  0 u()	G. 10

Indeed, let y2 := ||u||2 <  and yb := ||u||b < ; it follows from the H older's inequality that for any value p	(2, b) ||u||p  Z2,b (y2 , yb ; p) =: b (p). Therefore, it is more than natural to suppose in this section that the initial value function u0 = u0 (x) belongs to some Grand Lebesgue Space G, supp  = [2, b) with b > d. Theorem 4.1. Let the initial value function u0 = u0 (x) belongs to some Grand Lebesgue Space G, such that supp  = [2, b) with b > d. Define a new function
d/p () (p) :=  (p)  max(1, 2 (u0 )). p

Proposition: sup ||u(t)||G()  1.

(4.3)

Proof. Let u0  G, then ||u0||p <  and moreover ||u0 ||p   (p), 2  p < b. It may be deduced after some (omitted here) calculations based on the the article of Shangbin Cui [1] that
d/p d/p sup ||u||p  max(1, 2 (u0 ))  ||u0||p  max(1, 2 (u0 ))	(p), p p t

or equally sup ||u(t)||G() = sup sup

This completes the proof of theorem 4.1.

Solvability in moment rearrangement spaces.

We retain the notations and assumptions of previous section. Let (X, |||  |||X ) be any moment rearrangement invariant space over Rd constructed by means of auxiliary space (V, <  >) with condition supp V = supp . Denote
d/p h0 (p) = max(1, 2 )   (p), p  supp . p

(5.1)

Theorem 5.1. sup |||u(t)|||X  < h0 () > .
t0

(5.2)

11

Proof is very simple. It follows from theorem 4.1
d/p ||u(t)||p  max(1, 2 )   (p) = h0 (p), t  0. p

(5.3)

Since the norm <  > is also rearrangement invariant, we deduce taking the norm <  > on both the sides of inequality (5.3): < ||u||p >  < h0 () >, (5.4) and this estimate is uniform on the variable t; t  0. Taking the supremum over variable t, we get to the proposition (5.2) of the regarded theorem.

Mixed norm estimates for solution.

It is known, see [1], [15]- [16] that the global in time solution u(x, t) = u(t) obeys the property
t

lim ||u(t)||p = 0.

We want in this section to characterize this feature on the language of anisotropic Grand Lebesgue spaces. 0 We suppose in this section that u0  L0 2  Lb , b > d or equally that the initial function u0 belongs to some G space with supp  = [2, b), d < b  . A new notations: r = r (p) = rd (p) := p(p - d + 2) , p  (d, b); D = {p, r (p)}, p-d

Concluding remarks.

1. First example. We retain here the assumptions and notations of fourth sections. Suppose in addition that
2p<b

sup  1/p (p) < .

(7.1)

This condition is satisfied if for example b =	and  (p) = pm M (p), where m = const <	and M (p) is positive continuous slowly varying as p   function. We have under condition (7.1) () (p)	(p), therefore, the proposition of theorem 4.1 may be rewritten in the considered case as follows: sup ||u(t)||G < .
t

(7.2).

2. Second example. We consider here the mixed norm estimates for solution, see sixth section. Note that d, (p)	 (p), even without the condition (7.1). Following, the proposition of theorem 6.1 has a view ||u||G < . (7.3) 3. It is known [10], [11], [15], [16] etc. that in general case, i.e. when the value  = ||u0||d is not sufficiently small, then the lifespan of solution of NS equation T may be finite (short-time solution). Perhaps, it is self-contained interest a quantitative estimate of the value T. For the non-linear Schr odinger's equation the estimate T  exp(C/) was obtained in the recent article [46].

4. At the same considerations may be provided for the NS equations with external force f = f (x, t) : ut = u + (u  )u + Q    (u  u) + f (x, t), x  Rd , t > 0; u(x, 0) = u0 (x), x  Rd . see [10] - [13], [18], [23], [33]. 5. Analogously to the content of this report may be considered a more general case of abstract (linear or not linear) parabolic equation of a view ut = Au + F (u, u; x, t) + f (x, t), u(x, 0) = a(x).

The detail investigation of this case when the initial condition and external force belong to some Sobolev's space may be found, e.g. in [30] - [32], [14], [28].
